# Core Concepts / Knowledge

This page contains a list of all prerequisites we think will be helpful to learn before studying the ARENA 2.0 program material. You can return to this page while you study. None of it is compulsory and some resources are likely to be much more helpful than others. We denote very high and high-priority resources with a double and single asterisk respectively, so if you have limited time then prioritise these. It is strongly recommended to at least read over everything with a double asterisk. Also, you should try and prioritise areas you think you might be weaker in than others (for instance, if you have a strong SWE background but less maths experience then you might want to spend more time on the maths sections). You can also return to this document throughout the programme, if there are any areas you want to brush up on.

The content is partially inspired by a similar doc handed out by Redwood to participants before the start of MLAB, as well as by pre-prerequisite material provided by Jacob Hilton on his GitHub page.

Throughout this document, there are some questions peppered in. It's not absolutely essential to answer all of these questions, but you should b able to answer most (or at least know how you might go about answering them).

If you are reading this, and know of any good material for these topics which we’ve missed out, please let us know and we might be able to add it in!

## Maths

### Neural Networks**

We won’t assume any deep knowledge of neural networks or machine learning before the programme starts, but it’s useful to have an idea of the basis so that the first week doesn’t have quite as steep a learning curve. The best introductory resources here are 3B1B’s videos on neural networks:

*   [But what is a neural network? | Chapter 1, Deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)
*   [Gradient descent, how neural networks learn | Chapter 2, Deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w)
*   [What is backpropagation really doing? | Chapter 3, Deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U)

You should prioritise the first two videos in this sequence.

Some questions you should be able to answer after this:

*   **Why do you need activation functions? Why couldn’t you just create a neural network by connecting up a bunch of linear layers?**
*   **What makes neural networks more powerful than basic statistical methods like linear regression?**
*   **What are the advantages of ReLU activations over sigmoids?**

### Linear algebra**

Linear algebra lies at the core of a lot of machine learning.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lc5-ykchkkSylhM77XrLuCzfthg8bEtdUTV5EUcArilVKPlh9NZQDWkVnp55s35HftZAWdmyVmh3h5g83HtkOscn1g7x4wS5JO8s4mujPV8N2RbBqoCKiY0K_lVRJgVj7zuSyqPV4SIkbsjaWUQkqJY)

Here is a list of things you should probably be comfortable with:

*   Linear transformations - what they are, and why they are important
    *   See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE) video from 3B1B
    *   **What is the problem in trying to create a neural network using only linear transformations?**
*   How[ matrix multiplication works](http://mlwiki.org/index.php/Matrix-Matrix_Multiplication)
*   Basic matrix properties: rank, trace, determinant, transpose
*   Bases, and basis transformations
    *   **Read the “**[**Privileged vs Free Basis**](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#def-privileged-basis)**” section of Anthropic’s “Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits” paper. Which kinds of operations might lead to the creation of privileged bases? Which linear operations would preserve a privileged basis? (you might want to come back to this question once you’re more familiar with the basics of neural networks and activation functions)**
*   Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
*   Different types of matrix, and their significance (e.g. symmetric, orthogonal, identity, rotation matrices)

[This video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) by 3B1B provides a good overview of these core topics (although you can probably skip it if you already have a reasonably strong mathematical background).

If you have a lot more time,[ Linear Algebra Done Right](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6) is the canonical textbook for covering this topic (although it will probably cover much more than you need to know). Alternatively, Neel Nanda has two[ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkPhwnvRe-8)[ videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EB23unfLSU) covering linear algebra extensively.

### Probability**

It's essential to understand the rules of probability, expected value and standard deviation, and helpful to understand independence and the normal distribution.

[This link](https://medium.com/jun94-devpblog/prob-stats-3-expected-value-variance-and-standard-deviation-bce9303d8da8) covers some of the essentials, and [this link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/c7bd52cd1c881d4b32bbe3cfb55f58d7_MIT18_05S14_Reading6a.pdf) dives a bit deeper with some of the maths involved.

> **What is the expected value and variance of the sum of two normally distributed random variables $X_1 \sim N(\mu_1, \sigma_1^2)$ and $X_2 \sim N(\mu_2, \sigma_2^2)$? Does it matter whether they are independent?**

### Calculus**

It's essential to understand differentiation and partial differentiation, and helpful to understand the basics of vector calculus including the chain rule and Taylor series.

Again, 3Blue1Brown has a good [video series](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus) on this.

> **Read [this PyTorch documentation page](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MSELoss.html) on the MSELoss. What is the derivative of this loss wrt the element $y_n$ (assuming we use mean reduction)? Same question for [this page](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html) on BCELoss.**

### Statistics*

It's helpful to understand estimators and standard errors.

[This page](https://stats.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Probability_Theory/Probability_Mathematical_Statistics_and_Stochastic_Processes_(Siegrist)/07%3A_Point_Estimation/7.01%3A_Estimators) contains a pretty useful overview of several concepts related to statistical estimators (although not all of it is essential).

Additionally, the first 1 hr 15 mins of[ Neel Nanda’s YouTube video on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkPhwnvRe-8) also talks about its relation to statistics, covering topics like linear regression and hypothesis testing.

### Information theory

It's helpful to understand information, entropy and KL divergence. These play key roles in interpreting loss functions.

[Elements of Information Theory](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cgong821/Wiley.Interscience.Elements.of.Information.Theory.Jul.2006.eBook-DDU.pdf) by Thomas M. Cover is the textbook recommended by Jacob Hilton. It will probably cover more than you need to know, and this need not be prioritised over other items on the list.

For an overview of Kullback Leibler divergence (an important concept in information theory and machine learning), see[ Six (and a half) intuitions for KL divergence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/no5jDTut5Byjqb4j5/six-and-a-half-intuitions-for-kl-divergence). Note that this probably won’t make sense if you don’t already have a solid grasp of what entropy is.

> **Why is cross entropy loss a natural choice when training classifiers? The post above might help answer this question (note that KL divergence and cross entropy differ by a constant).**

## Programming

### Python**

It’s important to be strong in Python, because this is the language we’ll be using during the programme. As a rough indication, we expect you to be comfortable with at least 80-90% of the material [**here**](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/), up to section **“21. for/else”**. For a more thorough treatment of Python’s core functionality, see [**here**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

### Libraries

The following libraries would be useful to know to at least a basic level, before the course starts.

#### [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**

Being familiar with NumPy is a staple for working with high-performance Python. Additionally, the syntax for working with NumPy arrays is very similar to how you work with PyTorch tensors (often there are only minor differences, e.g. Torch tends to use the keyword axis where NumPy uses dim). Working through[ these 100 basic NumPy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100_Numpy_exercises.ipynb) would be a good idea, or if you’re comfortable with NumPy already then you could try doing them in PyTorch (see below).

#### [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)**

We will be starting chapter 0 of the programme with some structured exercises designed to get everyone familiar with working in PyTorch. However, the more comfortable you are with PyTorch going in, the easier you’ll probably find this. PyTorch has several useful tutorials, and to get comfortable working with tensors you might want to implement the 100 basic NumPy exercises linked to above, using PyTorch instead. Another option would be this [Learn the Basics](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) tutorial. You can skip this if you can clearly explain:

> * **At a high level, what is a `torch.Tensor`?**
> * **What is a `nn.Parameter`, and `nn.Module`?**
> * **When you call `.backward()`, where are your gradients stored?**
> * **What is a loss function? In general, what does it take for arguments, and what does it return?**
> * **What does an optimization algorithm do?**
> * **What is a hyperparameter, and how does it differ from a regular parameter?**
> * **What are some examples of hyperparameters?**

#### [Einops](https://einops.rocks/1-einops-basics) and [Einsum](https://einops.rocks/api/einsum/)*

These are great libraries to get comfortable with, when manipulating tensors. If you’re comfortable using them, then you can say goodbye to awkward NumPy/PyTorch methods like transpose, permute and squeeze! We’ll have a few einops and einsum exercises on the second day of the fundamentals chapter, but the more comfortable you are with these libraries the faster you’ll be.

For einops, you can read through the examples up to “Fancy examples in random order”. It’s worth trying to play around with these in your own Jupyter notebook, to get more comfortable with them.

For einsum,[ this page](https://rockt.github.io/2018/04/30/einsum) provides a basic intro to einstein summation convention, and shows some example tensor implementations. Note that we’ll be using the einsum function from the einops library, which allows you to refer to dimensions by name rather than by a single letter.

#### [Typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)*

Type-checking Python functions that you write is a great way to catch bugs, and keep your code clear and readable. Python isn’t a strongly-typed language so you won’t get errors from using incorrect type specifications unless you use a library like MyPy. However, if you’re using VSCode then you can pair this library with a really useful automatic type checker (see next section).

#### [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python)

Plotly is an interactive graphing library which is great for presenting results and investigating data. If you’re already very familiar with a different Python plotting library (e.g. matplotlib) then I wouldn’t recommend re-learning Plotly, but if you aren’t already very familiar with matplotlib or you’re open to learning Plotly, I’d strongly recommend giving it a try!

#### [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io)

Streamlit is a cool library for building and sharing data-based applications. It integrates very nicely with Plotly (see above), can be hosted on your personal GitHub, and is very intuitive & easy to learn relative to other libraries with similar features (e.g. Dash). This is not compulsory, but if you like the look of Streamlit then you might want to think about using it as a way to submit (or even make public) your end-of-week or capstone projects. See[ this extremely simple page](https://callummcdougall-new-repo-home-qghfdp.streamlitapp.com/) I (Callum) made for visualising results from Neel Nanda’s grokking paper, as an example of what Streamlit & Plotly can do.

## Software Engineering

### Basic coding skills**

If you’ve been accepted into this programme, then you probably already have this box ticked! However, polishing this area can’t hurt. LeetCode is a good place to keep basic coding skills sharp, in particular practising the planning and implementation of functions in the medium-hard sections of LeetCode might be helpful. Practising problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is another idea.

### VSCode**

Although many of you might already be familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, we recommend working through structured exercises using VSCode. This is a powerful text editor which provides more features than Jupyter Notebooks. Some features it has are:

* **Shortcuts**  
    These are much more powerful than anything offered in Jupyter Notebooks. Below is a table of some particularly useful ones (see [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/visual-studio-code-shortcuts-for-windows-and-mac/) for more detail on how each of them works).
    |       Commands       |                   Windows/Linux                   |                         MAC                         |
    |:--------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|

    |    Format Document   |                  Ctrl + Shift + i                 |                   Cmd + Shift + i                   |
    | Toggle Block Comment |                  Ctrl + Shift + /                 |                   Cmd + Shift + /                   |
    |    Command Palette   |                  Ctrl + Shift + P                 |                   Cmd + Shift + P                   |
    |  Toggle Line Comment |                      Ctrl + /                     |                       Cmd + /                       |

    |    Toggle Sidebar    |                      Ctrl + B                     |                       Cmd + B                       |

    |      Quick Open      |                      Ctrl + P                     |                       Cmd + P                       |
<br>

* **Type checking**      
    We discussed the typing module in a section above. This is particularly powerful when used alongside VSCode’s type checker extension. You can activate typing by going to the `settings.json` file in VSCode, and adding this line:  
    
    ```json
    {
        "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic"
    }
    ```

    You can open the `settings.json` file by first opening VSCode's Command Palette (see the shortcuts above), then finding the option Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON). We won’t be using type checking like this in the course, because it can be a bit too strict sometimes, but it’s a useful thing to know about.

* **Notebook functionality**  
Although VSCode does provide an extension which acts just like a Jupyter Notebook, it actually has a much more useful feature. Python files can also be made to act like notebooks, by adding the line #%% which act as cell dividers. In this way, you can separate chunks of code and run them individually (and see their output in a new window). See[ this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) for a further explanation.  
  
* **Debugger**  
The VSCode debugger is a great tool, and can be much more powerful and efficient than the standard practice of adding lines to print information about your output! You can set breakpoints in your code, and closely examine the local variables which are stored at that point in the program. More information can be found on[ this page](https://lightrun.com/debugging/debug-python-in-vscode/).  
  
* **Testing**  
VSCode provides ways to easily keep track of and run tests which are written using the pytest or unittest libraries. We’ll have a look at the former during the course.  
  
* **Remote machines**  
VSCode offers easy ways to execute code on remote machines over SSH.  
  
* **Copilot**  
GitHub Copilot uses the OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, right from your editor. We will be encouraging (although not requiring) use of copilot during the program. It can’t do everything, but it’s very helpful in abstracting away the annoying low-level details and allowing you to focus on the higher-level concepts and structures.  
  
* **Local imports**  
If you're getting squiggly yellow lines under local imports (or local imports aren't working), add this to the workspace JSON file (you can access it by searching "workspace JSON" into the command palette):

    ```json
    {
        "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
            "extrapath"
        ],
        "python.analysis.include": [
            "extrapath"
        ]
    }
    ```
    where `extrapath` is the path you want to add (e.g. `./chapter0_fundamentals/exercises`, if you're running imports like `import part1_raytracing.solutions as solutions`).
  
### Jupyter Notebook / Colab**

Despite the overall awesomeness of VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks still have some advantages over VSCode, primarily in exploration and visualisation. Several of the advantages listed in the previous section also apply to .ipynb files created and edited in VSCode; the main reason we’re not encouraging this for the ARENA in-person program is because we want participants to be able to write code that they can import from previous days (and because using .py files can help encourage better coding practices, rather than just creating a huge number of cells and dropping them under different headings, losing track of what code is where!).

Colab has a similar structure to Jupyter Notebooks, but it provides several additional features, most importantly GPU access. For anyone following this material virtually, we unfortunately won’t be able to provide compute, so (assuming you don’t have any way of accessing better compute yourselves e.g. via Lambda Labs) Colab might be the best option for you.

### Git**

Git is a piece of version control software, designed for tracking and managing changes in a set of files. It can be very powerful, but also a bit of a headache to use. 

If you’re following this course from the [repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_2.0), you’ll need to be comfortable using Git to push and pull files. We’ll also be encouraging you to make contributions to open source libraries during the program duration (e.g. TransformerLens during chapter 1), and this will also require comfort working with Git.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jpF1jPI7VGb9ssE-Lzn58nB_d4CQlZItqxhFFU_ZLTL3bv_x_82WVmgyIHQRDyemS7Ne5zpj4-rGVRkpACfR_u7Cw8DTGrMr8H_Sm7w74k03gfcJ2nkAwyk2CElLhMonZ6nhQiirM43DP40BIw1Id0k)

If you already have a strong SWE background then you might not need to spend as much time on this section. Otherwise, here are a few resources you might find useful for learning the basics of Git:

*   [An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
*   [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/index.html)
*   [Git cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet)

Ideally, you should feel comfortable with the following:

*   Cloning a repository
*   Creating and switching between branches
*   Staging and committing changes
*   Pushing branches

We expect that participants who have active github profiles with accessible repositories are more likely to have success in finding jobs than otherwise. 

### Conda*

Virtual environments are a common way to manage dependencies when working across multiple different projects and are standard practice in all professional development contexts. During ARENA, we expect that participants will be working inside likely one, but possibly more environments. 

If you haven’t used them already, please ensure that you have conda installed and know how to activate it. See: [Getting started with conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html). 

### Unix

This won’t matter a huge amount for this course (at least for the minimal versions of it), but it's an important part of your development as an engineer. [UNIX Tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) provides a comprehensive introduction (up to & including tutorial 3 should suffice for this course).

## Optional Reading

We will teach the course assuming you haven’t read any of these, but they are all useful and relevant things to know and will allow you to understand the material more deeply and/or tackle a more advanced Week 4 project.

#### [**100 NumPy Exercises**](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100)

After you’ve done the pre-course exercises, if you want more practice with this sort of thing, try these. Some of these are a lot more interesting than others - pick out some that sound fun and challenging and try solving them in PyTorch.

#### [**What is torch.nn really?**](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) **by Jeremy Howard**

You’ll be implementing a lot of functionality of torch.nn and torch.optim yourself during the course. This is a good introduction to what functionality is in these packages. If you don’t learn this now, you can pick it up during the course, though perhaps less deeply.

#### [**NLP Demystified**](https://www.nlpdemystified.org/) **by Nitin Punjabi**

An introduction to natural language processing assuming zero ML background.

*   If you’ve never done NLP before, it’s worth skimming to get a general idea of the field. 
*   If you’ve never built a basic feedforward neural network (MLP) from scratch, the section “Neural Networks I” has a good exercise on this.

#### [**Visualising Representations: Deep Learning and Human Beings**](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-01-Visualizing-Representations/) **by Chris Olah**

Builds intuition with nice pictures about what deep networks are doing inside.

#### [**Spinning Up in Deep RL**](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) **by OpenAI**

Introduction to using deep learning for reinforcement learning. ARENA will assume zero RL experience, but having some understanding already means you’ll have an easier time and can tackle more advanced versions of things in the course.

#### [**Introduction to Reinforcement Learning**](https://www.deepmind.com/learning-resources/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-with-david-silver) **with David Silver**

This video course is fairly old (2015) and the state of the art has come a long way, but this is still useful to cover the basics. I would recommend Spinning Up in Deep RL over this unless you learn better from video lectures than reading.

#### [**The Matrix Cookbook**](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf) **by Petersen and Pedersen**

A densely packed reference of facts and identities about matrices. Definitely not intended to teach topics, but a good place to look up something you need. It’s worth memorising identities 1-6, 11-16, and 18-23 from Page 6.

#### [**Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits**](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) **by Chris Olah et al**

A very fun article on interpretability in neural networks trained for computer vision.

#### [**Why Momentum Really Works**](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/) **by Gabriel Goh**

Variations of gradient descent that use momentum are extremely common. We’ll teach the basics of momentum in the course, but if you want a richer and deeper understanding then this is a good article to read and reread.

#### [**The Matrix Calculus You Need for Deep Learning**](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/) **by Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard**

Takes you from knowing introductory calculus to calculus on matrices. This will be helpful for the backpropagation material, on day 3 of the course.

#### [**A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits**](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) **by Anthropic**

Analyses transformers starting with the simplest toy models and working up. A heavy read but very good for building intuition about what transformers can do. This will form the cornerstone of the mechanistic interpretability chapter.

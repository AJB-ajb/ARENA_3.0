# Chapter 0: Fundamentals

The material on this page covers the first five days of the curriculum. It can be seen as a grounding in all the fundamentals necessary to complete the more advanced sections of this course (such as RL, transformers, mechanistic interpretability, and generative models).

Some highlights from this chapter include:
* Building your own 1D and 2D convolution functions
* Building and loading weights into a Residual Neural Network, and finetuning it on a classification task
* Working with [weights and biases](https://wandb.ai/site) to optimise hyperparameters
* Implementing your own backpropagation mechanism
* Building your own GANs and VAEs, and using them to generate images

These exercises go through some prerequisites for the rest of the chapter. A lot of reading material is provided. There are also some exercises on the `einops` and `einsum` libraries, as well as basic tensor manipulation - topics which will be very useful for subsequent exercises.

These exercises take you through the basics of PyTorch: how to write batched operations and do simple linear algebra. They also take you through the basic ideas behind raytracing, and how to render your own 3D mesh.

            r"""
This section is designed to get you familiar with basic neural networks: how they are structured, the basic operations like linear layers and convolutions which go into making them, and why they work as well as they do. You'll start by building your own very simple neural network to classify MNIST digits, but by the end of these exercises you'll be building and training your own ResNet to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In these exercises, we explore various optimization algorithms and their roles in training deep learning models. We will delve into the inner workings of SGD, RMSprop, and Adam, and learn how to implement them. We'll also take a look at Weights and Biases, a tool that can be used to track and visualize the training process, and test different values of hyperparameters to find the most effective ones.

In this section, you're going to build your very own system that can run the backpropagation algorithm in essentially the same way as PyTorch does. By the end of the day, you'll be able to train a multi-layer perceptron neural network, using your own backprop system!

These exercises take you through two very important architectures for image generation: generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). Both are important when it comes to understanding more complex image-generation architectures such as diffusion models, and autoencoders are also used widely in many contexts (we'll encounter them later in the course!).

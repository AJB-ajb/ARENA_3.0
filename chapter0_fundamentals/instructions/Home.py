# Chapter 0: Fundamentals

The material on this page covers the first five days of the curriculum. It can be seen as a grounding in all the fundamentals necessary to complete the more advanced sections of this course (such as RL, transformers, mechanistic interpretability, and generative models).

Some highlights from this chapter include:
* Building your own 1D and 2D convolution functions
* Building and loading weights into a Residual Neural Network, and finetuning it on a classification task
* Working with [weights and biases](https://wandb.ai/site) to optimise hyperparameters
* Implementing your own backpropagation mechanism
* Building your own GANs and VAEs, and using them to generate images

## About this page

This page was made using an app called Streamlit. It's hosted from the main course [GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/Prerequisite-materials). It provides a very simple way to display markdown, as well as more advanced features like interactive plots and animations. This is how the instructions for each day will be presented.

On the left, you can see a sidebar (or if it's collapsed, you will be able to see if you click on the small arrow in the top-left to expand it). This sidebar should show a page called `Home` (which is the page you're currently reading), as well as one for each of the different parts of today's exercises.

If you want to change to dark mode, you can do this by clicking the three horizontal lines in the top-right, then navigating to Settings → Theme.

## How to access the course

### Option 1: Colab

This option is recommended if either of the following is true:

* You have limited access to GPU support
* You want to avoid the hassle of setting up your own environment

You can see all the Colab files in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UTg3Xsmf77IYFFfj17dagJIsMKwmPsAi?usp=sharing). Also, you can get individual links in the dropdown below.

</details>

For each of these sections, you can make a copy of the **exercises** notebooks in your own drive, and fill in the code cells whenever indicated. Use the **solutions** notebook when you're stuck (they have all code cells filled in & run, and output displayed).

### Option 2: VSCode

This is the option we strongly recommend for all participants of the in-person ARENA program, and for people who are more comfortable with things like setting up their coding workspace (and who have access to a good GPU).

<details>
<summary>Click this dropdown for setup instructions.</summary>

First, clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_2.0) into your local directory. The repo has the following structure (omitting the unimportant parts):

```
.
├── chapter0_fundamentals
│   ├── exercises
│   │   ├── part1_ray_tracing
│   │   │   ├── solutions.py
│   │   │   ├── tests.py
│   │   │   └── answers.py*
│   │   ├── part2_cnns
│   │   ⋮    ⋮
│   └── instructions
│       └── Home.py
├── chapter1_transformers
├── chapter2_rl
├── chapter3_training_at_scale
└── requirements.txt
```

There is a directory for each chapter of the course (e.g. `chapter0_fundamentals`). Each of these directories has an `instructions` folder (which contain the files used to generate the pages you're reading right now) `exercises` folder (where you'll be doing the actual exercises). The latter will contain a subfolder for each day of exercises, and that folder will contain files such as `solutions.py` and `tests.py` (as well as other data sometimes, which gets used as part of the exercises). To do the exercises, you'll be creating a file `answers.py` (or `.ipynb` if you prefer) in the same folder as the solutions and tests files. You'll then go through the corresponding streamlit page, copying over & running code (filling in the blanks as you go).

You'll be completing the exercises in an `answers.py` (or file in this subfolder (which you'll need to create).

Once you've cloned the repo and navigated into it (at the root directory), follow these steps:

* Make & activate a virtual environment.
    * We strongly recommend using `conda` for this. You can install `conda` [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), and find basic instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
    * The command for creating a new env is `conda create --name arena python=3.11`.
* Install requirements.
    * First, install PyTorch.
        * If you're on Windows, the command is `conda install pytorch=1.13.1 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia`.
        * If you're on MAC/Linux, the command is `conda install pytorch=1.13.1 torchvision`.
    * Then install the rest of the requirements by navigating to the root directory for ARENA 3.0, and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
        
</details>

Note - if you choose this option, then you may require more compute than your laptop can provide. If you're following this material virtually, you may want to consider a cloud provider such as Lambda Labs or Paperspace.

<details>
<summary>Setup instructions for Lambda Labs.</summary>

Here is a set of instructions for spinning up a Lambda Labs instance, and accessing it via VSCode. We may shortly add more sets of instructions for other cloud providers (since Lambda Labs has finite capacity, and it isn't always possible to find a free instance).

### Instructions for signing up

Sign up for an account [here](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud).

Add an **SSH key**. Give it a name like `lambda_labs_key` (we will refer to this as `<keyname>` from now on).

When you create it, it will automatically be downloaded. The file may have a `.pem` extension - this is a common container format for keys or certificates.

<br>

### VSCode remote-ssh extension

The [**remote ssh extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) is very useful for abstracting away some of the messy command-line based details of SSH. You should install this extension now.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/architecture-ssh.png" width="600">

At this point, the instructions differ between Windows and Linux/MacOS.

##### Windows

Having installed the SSH extension, Windows may have automatically created a .ssh file for you, and it will be placed in `C:\Users\<user>` by default. If it hasn't done this, then you should create one yourself (you can do this from the Windows command prompt via `md C:\Users\<user>\.ssh`).

Move your downloaded SSH key into this folder. Then, set permissions on the SSH key:
		
* Right click on file, press “Properties”, then go to the “Security” tab.
* Click “Advanced”, then “Disable inheritance” in the window that pops up.
    
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/instruction1.png" width="500">

* Choose the first option “Convert inherited permissions…”

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/instruction2.png" width="500">

* Go back to the “Security” tab, click "Edit" to change permissions, and remove every user except the owner.
    * You can check who the owner is by going back to "Security -> Advanced" and looking for the "Owner" field at the top of the window).

##### Linux / MacOS

* Make your `.ssh` directory using the commands `mkdir -p ~/.ssh` then `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`.
* Set permissions on the key: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<keyname>`

<br>

### Launch your instance

Go back to the Lambda Labs page, go to "instances", and click "Launch instance".

You'll see several options, some of them might be greyed out if unavailable. Pick a cheap one (we're only interested in testing this at the moment, and at any rate even a relatively cheap one will probably be more powerful than the one you're currently using in your laptop). 

Enter your SSH key name. Choose a region (your choice here doesn't really matter for our purposes).

Once you finish this process, you should see your GPU instance is running:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_instance.png" width="700">

You should also see an SSH LOGIN field, which will have the form `ssh <user>@<ip-address>`.

Now, you should set up a **config file** - this will remove the need to use long command line arguments, e.g. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/<keyname> ubuntu@instance-ip-address`.

Open the command palette (this is Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows, Cmd+Shif+P for Mac), search for the option "Open SSH Configuration File...", then click on the option `C:\\Users\\<user>\\.ssh\\config` for Windows / `~/.ssh/config` for Linux/MacOS. If you haven't used this file before, then an empty config file will open. You should copy in the following instructions:

```c
Host lambdalabs
    HostName <ip-address>
    IdentityFile <path-to-ssh-key>
    User <user>
```

where `<ip-address>` and `<user>` come from the **SSH LOGIN** field in the table, and `<path-to-ssh-key>` is the path at which you saved the SSH key. So from my Windows machine, this would look like:

```c
Host lambdalabs
    HostName 150.136.64.192
    IdentityFile C:/Users/calsm/.ssh/lambda_labs_key
    User <user>
```

<br>

### Connect to your instance

Open the command palette, and search for & choose the option "Connect to Host...". The host `lambdalabs` should appear as one of the hosts. Choose this option.

A new VSCode window will open up. If you're asked if you want to install the recommended extensions for Python, click yes. If you're asked to choose an OS (Windows, Mac or Linux), choose Linux.

Click on the file explorer icon in the top-left, and open the directory `ubuntu` (or whichever directory you want to use as your working directory in this machine). 

And there you go - you're all set! 

To check your GPU is working, you can open a Python or Notebook file and run `!nvidia-smi`. You should see GPU information which matches the machine you chose from the Lambda Labs website, and is different from the result you get from running this command on your local machine. 

Another way to check out your GPU For instance is to run the PyTorch code `torch.cuda.get_device_name()`. For example, this is what I see after SSHing in:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_type.png" width="500">
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_type_2.png" width="450">

You can also use `torch.cuda.get_device_properties` (which takes your device as an argument).

Once you've verified this is working, you can start running code on GPUs. The easiest way to do this is just to drag and drop your files into the file explorer window on the left hand side.

<br>

### Set up your workspace

You might already know how to do this, but here are the steps I go through (thanks to Arthur Conmy for most of these!).

1. Open a terminal, with `Ctrl + Shift + '`.
2. Run `git clone <repo-url>`, where `<repo-url>` is the URL of the GitHub repo you want to clone.
    * In the case of ARENA 3.0, the repo url is `git@github.com:callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0.git`.
    * In the case of general repositories, you should go to the GitHub page, click on the `Code` button, and copy the SSH URL.
3. Install extensions (Python, Jupyter, Copilot) using the extensions tab on the left.
4. Install & activate miniconda using:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

5. Exit the terminal, and open it again. Run the following code to create a new conda environment, and open it by default (feel free to name your environment whatever you want):

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.11 -y
conda activate myenv
echo "conda activate myenv" >> ~/.bashrc
```

6. Install requirements. This requires running `cd ARENA_3.0` first, and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

7. Whenever you open a python file, make sure the interpreter is `myenv`. If you're using a Jupyter Notebook, you can change the kernel by clicking on the `Kernel` tab, then `Change kernel`, then `myenv`.

See the **prerequisites section** (left-hand sidebar) for more advice on using VSCode.

## Completing the exercises

### Hints

There will be occasional hints throughout the document, for when you're having trouble with a certain task but you don't want to read the solutions. Click on the expander to reveal the solution in these cases. Below is an example of what they'll look like:

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm stuck on a particular problem.</summary>

Here is the answer!
</details>

Always try to solve the problem without using hints first, if you can.

### Test functions

Most of the blocks of code will also come with test functions. These are imported from python files with names such as `exercises/part1_raytracing_tests.py`. You should make sure these files are in your working directory while you're writing solutions. One way to do this is to clone the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_2.0) into your working directory, and run it there. When we decide exactly how to give participants access to GPUs, we might use a different workflow, but this should suffice for now. Make sure that you're getting the most updated version of utils at the start of every day (because changes might have been made), and keep an eye out in the `#errata` channel for mistakes which might require you to change parts of the test functions.

### Tips

* To get the most out of these exercises, make sure you understand why all of the assertions should be true, and feel free to add more assertions.
* If you're having trouble writing a batched computation, try doing the unbatched version first.
* If you find these exercises challenging, it would be beneficial to go through them a second time so they feel more natural.
* You can use our experimental chatbot assistant to answer questions about the course (navigate to it from the left-hand sidebar). This was inspired by [AlignmentSearch](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bGn9ZjeuJCg7HkKBj/introducing-alignmentsearch-an-ai-alignment-informed), and has similar benefits and drawbacks relative to the alternative of using GPT directly.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback on this course (e.g. bugs, confusing explanations, parts that you feel could be structured better), please let us know in the [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/arena-la82367/shared_invite/zt-1uvoagohe-JUv9xB7Vr143pdx1UBPrzQ), e.g. the `errata` channel (for mistakes) or `suggestions` channels (for suggestions). We're always looking to improve the course, and we'd really appreciate your input.

# ## Support

# If you ever need help, you can send a message on the ARENA Slack channel `#technical-questions`. You can also reach out to a TA (e.g. Callum) if you'd like a quick videocall to talk through a concept or a problem that you've been having, although there might not always be someone available.

# You can also read the solutions by downloading them from the [GitHub](https://github.com/callummcdougall/arena-v1). However, ***this should be a last resort***. Really try and complete the exercises as a pair before resorting to the solutions. Even if this involves asking a TA for help, this is preferable to reading the solutions. If you do have to read the solutions, then make sure you understand why they work rather than just copying and pasting. 

# At the end of each day, it can be beneficial to look at the solutions. However, these don't always represent the optimal way of completing the exercises; they are just how the author chose to solve them. If you think you have a better solution, we'd be really grateful if you could send it in, so that it can be used to improve the set of exercises for future ARENA iterations.

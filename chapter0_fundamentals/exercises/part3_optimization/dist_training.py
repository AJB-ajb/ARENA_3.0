# 3️⃣ Distributed Training


## Intro to distributed training

Distributed training is a model training paradigm that involves spreading training workload across multiple worker nodes, therefore significantly improving the speed of training and model accuracy. While distributed training can be used for any type of ML model training, it is most beneficial to use it for large models and compute demanding tasks as deep learning.

There are 2 main families of distributed training methods: **data parallelism** and **model parallelism**. In data parallelism, we split batches of data across different processes, run forward & backward passes on each separately, and accumulate the gradients to update the model parameters. In model parallelism, the model is segmented into different parts that can run concurrently in different nodes, and each one runs on the same data. Model parallelism further splits into horizontal and vertical parallelism depending on whether we're splitting the model up into sequential or parallel parts. Most often horizontal parallelism is called **tensor parallelism** (because it involves splitting up the weights in a single layer across multiple GPUs, into what we commonly call **sharded weights**), and vertical parallelism is called **pipeline parallelism**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/parallelism.png" width="1100">

Data & model parallelism are both widely used, and can be more or less appropriate in different circumstances (e.g. some kind of model parallelism is necessary when your model is too large to fit on a single GPU). However it is possible to create hybrid forms of parallelism by combining these; this is especially common when training large models like current SOTA LLMs. In these exercises, we'll focus on just data parallelism, although we'll suggest a few bonus exercises that explore model parallelism.

### Summary of exercises

The exercises below will take you through **data parallelism**. You'll start by learning how to use the basic send and receive functions in PyTorch's distributed training module `torch.distributed` to transfer tensors between different processes (and different GPUs). Note that **you'll need multiple GPUs for these exercises** - we've included instructions in a dropdown below.

<details>
<summary>Getting multiple GPUs</summary>

The instructions for booting up a machine from vastai can already be found on the Streamlit homepage (i.e. navigate to "Home" on the sidebar, then to the section "Virtual Machines"). The only extra thing you'll need to do here is filter for an appropriate machine type.

We recommend filtering for "Disk Space To Allocate" (i.e. the primary slider on the top of the filter menu) of at least 40GB, not for the model (which is actually quite small) but for installing the ARENA dependencies. You should also filter for number of GPUs: we recommend 4x or 8x. You can do this using the options menu at the very top of the list of machines. Lastly, we recommend filtering for a decent PCIE Bandwidth (e.g. at least 20GB/s) - this is important for efficient gradient sychronization between GPUs. We're training a small model today: approx 22m parameters, which translates to ~88MB total size of weights, and so we'll transfer 88MB of data between GPUs per process (since we're transferring the model's gradients, which have the same size as the weights). We don't want this to be a bottleneck, which is why we should filter for this bandwidth.

Once you've filtered for this, we recommend picking an RTX 3090 or 4090 machine. These won't be as powerful as an A100, but the purpose today is more to illustrate the basic ideas behind distributed training than to push your model training to its limits. Note that if you were using an A100 then you should filter for a high NVLink Bandwidth rather than PCIE (since A100s use NVLink instead of PCIE).

</details>

Once you've done this, you'll use those 2 primitive point-to-point functions to build up some more advanced functions: `broadcast` (which gets a tensor from one process to all others), `gather` (which gathers all tensors from different devices to a single device) and `all_reduce` (which combines both `broadcast` and `gather` to make aggregate tensor values across all processes). These functions (`all_reduce` in particular) are key parts of how distributed computing works.

Lastly, you'll learn how to use these functions to build a distributed training loop, which will be adapted from the `ResNetTrainer` code from your previous exercises. We also explain how you can use `DistributedDataParallel` to abstract away these low-level operations, which you might find useful later on (although you will benefit from building these components up from scratch, and understanding how they work under the hood).


### Running these exercises

If you've been working in a notebook, you'll need to switch over to a Python file now. This is because distributed training typically requires spawning multiple processes, and Jupyter notebooks run in a single interactive process - they're not designed for this kind of use-case. You can still run the code in a Python file using either `# %%`-separated cells or [execute on selection](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38952053/how-can-i-run-text-selected-in-the-active-editor-in-vs-codes-integrated-termina), but you'll need to make sure any execution code is wrapped in `if MAIN:` blocks, so when you launch multiple processes they don't recursively launch their own processes. Also, make sure to save the file before executing code, because otherwise the launched processes might be executing a stale version of the functions you've written.


## Basic send & receiving

The code below is a simplified example that demonstrates distributed communication between multiple processes.

At the highest level, `mp.spawn()` launches multiple worker processes, each with a unique rank. For each worker, we create a new Python interpreter (called a "child process") which will execute the function passed to `mp.spawn` (which in this case is `send_receive`). The function has to have the type signature `fn(rank, *args)` where `args` is the tuple we pass into `mp.spawn()`. The total number of processes is determined by `world_size`. Note that this isn't the same as the number of GPUs - in fact, in the code below we've not moved any of our data to GPUs, we're just using the distributed API to sync data across multiple processes. We'll introduce GPUs in the code below this!

We require the environment variables `MASTER_ADDR` and `MASTER_PORT` to be set before launching & communicating between processes. The former specifies the IP address or hostname of the machine that will act as the central coordinator (the "master" node) for setting up and managing the distributed environment, while the latter specifies the port number that the master node will use for communication. In our case we're running all our processes from a single node, so all we need is for this to be an unused port on our machine.

Now, breaking down the `send_receive` function line by line:

- `dist.init_process_group` initializes each process with a common address and port, and a communication backend. It also gives each process a unique rank, so they know who is sending & receiving data.
- If the function is being run by rank 0, then we create a tensor of zeros and send it using `dist.send`.
- If the function is being run by rank 1, then we create a tensor of ones and wait to receive a tensor from rank 0 using `dist.recv`. This will overwrite the data in the original tensor that we created, i.e. so we're just left with a tensor of zeros.
- `dist.destroy_process_group()` is called at the end of the function to destroy the process group and release resources.

The functions `dist.send` and `dist.recv` are the basic primitives for point-to-point communication between processes (we'll look at the primitives for collective communication later on). Each `recv` for a given source process `src` will wait until it receives a `send` from that source to continue, and likewise each `send` to a given destination process `dst` will wait until it receives a `recv` from that process to continue. We call these **blocking operations** (later on we'll look at non-blocking operations).

"""
Now, let's adapt this toy example to work with our multiple GPUs! You can check how many GPUs you have access to using `torch.cuda.device_count()`.

Before writing our new code, let's first return to the `backend` argument for `dist.init_process_group`. There are 3 main backends for distributed training: MPI, GLOO and NCCL. The first two are more general-purpose and support both CPU & GPU tensor communication, while NCCL is a GPU-only protocol optimized specifically for NVIDIA GPUs. It provides better bandwidth and lower latency for GPU-GPU communication, and so we'll be using it for subsequent exercises.

When sending & receiving tensors between GPUs with a NCCL backend, there are 3 important things to remember:

1. Send & received tensors should be of the same datatype.
2. Tensors need to be moved to the GPU before sending or receiving.
3. No two processes should be using the same GPU.

Because of this third point, each process `rank` will be using the GPU with index `rank` - hence we'll sometimes refer to the process rank and its corresponding GPU index interchangeably. However it's worth emphasizing that this only applies to our specific data parallelism & NCCL backend example, and so this correspondence doesn't have to exist in general.

The code below is a slightly modified version of the prior code; all we're doing is changing the backend to NCCL & moving the tensors to the appropriate device before sending or receiving.

Note - if at any point during this section you get errors related to the socket, then you can kill the processes by running `kill -9 <pid>` where `<pid>` is the process ID. If the process ID isn't given in the error message, you can find it using `lsof -i :<port>` where `<port>` is the port number specified in `os.environ["MASTER_PORT"]` (note you might have to `sudo apt-get install lsof` before you can run this). If your code is still failing, try changing the port in `os.environ["MASTER_PORT"]` and running it again.

Note - an alternative to explicitly defining the device here is to run the line `torch.cuda.set_device(rank)`, then code like `tensor.cuda()` will automatically send the tensor to the correct device. Which one you use is a matter of preference, however for the solutions & demo code we'll stick with the explicit device definition.



## Collective communication primitives

We'll now move from basic point-to-point communication to **collective communication**. This refers to operations that synchronize data across multiple processes, rather than just between a single sender and receiver. There are 3 important kinds of collective communication functions:

- **Broadcast**: send a tensor from one process to all other processes
- **Gather**: collect tensors from all processes and concatenates them into a single tensor
- **Reduce**: like gather, but perform a reduction operation (e.g. sum, mean) rather than concatenation

The latter 2 functions have different variants depending on whether you want the final result to be in just a single destination process or in all of them: for example `dist.gather` will gather data to a single destination process, while `dist.all_gather` will make sure every process ends up with all the data.

The functions we're most interested in building are `broadcast` and `all_reduce` - the former for making sure all processes have the same initial model parameters, and the latter for aggregating gradients across all processes.

### Exercise - implement `broadcast`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

Below, you should implement `broadcast`. 

If you have tensor $T_i$ on process $i$ for each index, then after this function you should have $T_s$ on all processes, where $s$ is the source process. If you're confused, you can see exactly what is expected of you by reading the test code in `tests.py`. Again, remember that you should be running tests either from the command line or in the Python interactive terminal, not in a notebook cell.

### Exercise - implement `all_reduce`

```c
Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

You should now implement `all_reduce`. We've given you a skeleton for the function, which works in 2 parts:

1. `reduce` the tensors to some destination process, e.g. process 0 (i.e. so that process has the sum or mean of all tensors)
2. Use your previous function `broadcast` to send the reduced tensor to all processes

so all you have to do is implement the `reduce` function. After you run `all_reduce`, you should go from having tensor $T_i$ on each process $i$ to having $\sum_j T_j / N$ on all processes (where $N=1$ if `op = "sum" or the number of processes if `op = "mean"`).

Note, more complicated ways of implementing allreduce do exist, but we'll only look at those in the bonus material.

Once you've passed these tests, you can run the code below to see how this works for a toy example of model training. In this case our model just has a single parameter and we're performing gradient descent using the squared error between its parameters and the input data as our loss function (in other words we're training the model's parameters to equal the mean of the input data). 

The data in the example below is the same as the rank index, i.e. $r = 0, 1$. For initial parameters $x = 2$ this gives us errors of $(x - r)^2 = 4$ and $2$, and gradients of $2x(x - r) = 8$ and $4$ respectively. Averaging these gives us gradients of $6$, so after a single optimization step with learning rate $0.1$ we get our gradients changing to $2.0 - 0.6 = 1.4$.

## Full training loop

We'll now use everything we've learned to put together a full training loop! Rather than finetuning it which we've been doing so far, you'll be training your resnet from scratch (although still using the same CIFAR10 dataset). This means you'll need to rewrite your `get_resnet_for_feature_extraction` function from earlier - it should just create a `ResNet34()` and replace the last linear layer with a randomly initialized layer that just has 10 channels. No weight downloading and copying or layer freezing is needed! 

There are 3 key elements you'll need to change from the non-distributed version of training:

1. **Weight broadcasting at initialization**
    - For each process you'll need to initialize your model and move it onto the corresponding GPU, but you also want to make sure each process is working with the same model. You do this by **broadcasting weights in the `__init__` method**, e.g. using process 0 as the shared source process.
    - Note - you may find you'll have to brodcast `param.data` rather than `param` when you iterate through the model's parameters, because broadcasting only works for tensors not parameters. Parameters are a special class wrapping around and extending standard PyTorch tensors - we'll look at this in more detail tomorrow!
2. **Parameter syncing after each training step**
    - After each `loss.backward()` call but before stepping with the optimizer, you'll need to use `all_reduce` to sync gradients across each parameter in the model.
    - Just like in the example we gave above, calling `all_reduce` on `param.grad` should work, because `.grad` is a standard PyTorch tensor.
3. **Trainloader sampling at each epoch**
    - Distributed training works by splitting each batch of data across all the running processes, and so we need to implement this by splitting each batch randomly across our GPUs.

For (3), we've given you some sample code that implements this below. Note that each pair of tensors in `train_loader` will contain `self.args.batch_size` examples, meaning our effective batch size is actually `self.args.batch_size * world_size`. If we were using a standard optimizer like SGD then we'd want to adjust the learning rate accordingly (higher batch size = higher learning rate, so the variance of updates is balanced), but for adaptive optimizers like Adam this generally isn't necessary.

```python
# `__init__` method: Create sampler & loader during initialization
self.train_sampler = torch.utils.data.DistributedSampler(self.trainset, num_replicas=args.world_size, rank=self.rank)
self.train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    self.trainset,
    self.args.batch_size,
    sampler=self.train_sampler,  # passing the sampler into the trainloader
    num_workers=2,  # setting this low so as not to risk bottlenecking CPU resources
    pin_memory=True,  # this can improve data transfer speed between CPU and GPU
)

# `train` method: make sure to set the epoch for the sampler:
self.train_sampler.set_epoch(epoch)
for imgs, labels in self.train_loader:
    ...
```

We also recommend that you play around with the dataloader parameters like `num_workers` and `pin_memory` to see if you can get improvements. There are some general heuristics to follow (e.g. `num_workers = 4 * num_gpus` is a common starting point), but a high number of workers can also compete for CPU resources and slow down your training (epochs taking a long time to start is a sign of this happening). The details of this will vary depending on your hardware, so you'll have to experiment!

<details>
<summary>Why don't we distribute the evaluation step across GPUs too?</summary>

This is an option, and you could implement it by e.g. computing both the number of correct predictions and total number of predictions made in each process then using `all_reduce` once to aggregate these values and give us a single accuracy score.

The main reason we don't do it is that the evaluation step usually shouldn't be a bottleneck for your training process, so it's not a big deal if it's not distributed. Evaluation usually involves a much smaller dataset, and also is done with gradients disabled & no backpropagation which makes it much faster than our training steps. If the evaluation step is a bottleneck for you, this is more likely a red flag indicating that you should be implementing this step differently, e.g. a smaller validation set.

</details>

We've given you the function `dist_train_resnet_from_scratch` which you'll be able to pass into `mp.spawn` just like the examples above. Your job is just to make the 3 adjustments listed above. You can start from your existing ResNet finetuning code, or you can take the solutions code for the previous section (which may have been written in a way that makes the distributed training modifications slightly easier).

## Bonus - DDP

In practice, the most convenient way to use DDP is to wrap your model in `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`, which removes the need for explicitly calling `broadcast` at the start and `all_reduce` at the end of each training step. When you define a model in this way, it will automatically broadcast its weights to all processes, and the gradients will sync after each `loss.backward()` call. Here's the example `SimpleModel` code from above, rewritten to use these features:

```python
import torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel as DDP

class SimpleModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.param = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.tensor([2.0]))

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor):
        return x - self.param


def run(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

    device = torch.device(f"cuda:{rank}")
    model = SimpleModel().to(device)
    self.model = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])  # Wrap the model with DDP
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

    input = torch.tensor([rank], dtype=torch.float32, device=device)
    output = model(input)
    loss = output.pow(2).sum()
    loss.backward()  # DDP handles gradient synchronization

    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Rank {rank}, new param: {model.module.param.data}")

    dist.destroy_process_group()


if MAIN:
    world_size = 2
    mp.spawn(run, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size, join=True)
```

Can you use these features to rewrite your ResNet training code? Can you compare it to the code you wrote and see how much faster the built-in DDP version is? Note, you won't be able to separate the time taken for backward passes and gradient synchronization since these happen in the same line, but you can assume that the time taken for the backward pass is approximately unchanged and so any speedup you see is due to the better gradient synchronization.

## Bonus - ring operations

Our all reduce operation would scale quite badly when we have a large number of models. It chooses a single process as the source process to receive then send out all data, and so this process risks becoming a bottleneck. One of the most popular alternatives is **ring all-reduce**. Broadly speaking, ring-based algorithms work by sending data in a cyclic pattern (i.e. worker `n` sends it to worker `n+1 % N` where `N` is the total number of workers). After each sending round, we perform a reduction operation to the data that was just sent. [This blog post](https://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/baidu-allreduce/) illustrates the ring all-reduce algorithm for the sum operation.

Can you implement the ring all-reduce algorithm by filling in the function below & passing tests? Once you've implemented it, you can compare the speed of your ring all-reduce vs the all-reduce we implemented earlier - is it faster? Do you expect it to be faster in this particular case?

We should expect this algorithm to be better when we scale up the number of GPUs, but it won't always be faster in small-world settings like ours, because the naive allreduce algorithm requires fewer individual communication steps and this could outweigh the benefits brought by the ring-based allreduce.

## Setting Up `DistributedDataParallel`

When training a model across multiple GPUs, we need to make sure that the gradients sychronize. Let's see how that works!

We're adding to our previous code in the following ways:

- Rather than creating a tensor in both processes, we're creating a model in both processes
    - This model has a single parameter, our loss fn is the squared difference between the input and the parameter, so GD will just push the parameter to the mean of the input
    - Calling `loss.backward()` is what causes the gradients to be sychronized across the GPUs

Some more notes:
- `model.module` refers to the original model wrapped by DDP
- Breaking down in more detail what happens in `loss.backward()`:
    - Local Gradient Calculation: Each rank calculates the gradient of param with respect to loss.
    - Gradient Synchronization: DDP performs an all-reduce operation on param.grad across all ranks, averaging the gradients.
    - to emphasize: loss.backward() is the only line that requires inter-rank synchronization, while all other lines execute independently on each rank

At the end, our grad is 3 (which is the average of 4 and 2, our grads from the outputs of -2 and -1 resp) so we step to get 1.7 from 2.0
"""


"""
Exercise (optional) - write your own all reduce function!

There exist things like `dist.all_reduce` which is more like how `loss.backward()` works under the hood, but we're going to write our own using just the basic primitives `dist.send` and `dist.recv`.



We'll implement our all_reduce in the simplest possible way
    (1) Every >0 rank sends its gradient to rank 0, which receives them and averages them
    (2) Rank 0 sends the summed gradient back to all other ranks

Important gotcha - remember that we need to be modifying tensors inplace in `all_reduce`! For example, in step (2) when
we're receiving the averaged gradient from rank 0, don't do something like this:
        tensor = torch.zeros_like(tensor, device="cpu")
        dist.recv(tensor, src=0)
or:
    dist.recv(tensor.cpu(), src=0)
because neither will modify `tensor` inplace! We instead recommend receiving into a new tensor and then copying that
new tensor to `tensor`, using e.g. the inplace modification method `tensor.copy_(...)`.

! EDIT - they're actually gather and broadcast instead, so I've written them that way.

Also note, you need to explain how dist.all_reduce(tensor, op=dist.ReduceOp.SUM) works, cause we'll use that later!

# ! Second edit - apparently you don't even need to send them via the CPU, so I guess edit earlier shit.

Exercise (bonus) - broadcast & allreduce, using non-blocking send/recv

And now, we present the distributed version which should hopefully be much faster!

#             self.train_sampler.set_epoch(epoch)
This line is used to set the epoch for the DistributedSampler. It ensures that the data is shuffled differently at each epoch, which is important for distributed training to ensure that each process gets a different subset of data in each epoch. This helps in achieving better convergence and avoiding overfitting to a specific data order.

Help - I get `RuntimeError: Inplace update to inference tensor outside InferenceMode is not allowed...`
I think this happens in evaluation, when you're summing up the correct predictions and the total samples. Try and do this in a non-inplace way

    inference_mode() is a stricter version of no_grad() that enables additional optimizations by guaranteeing that tensors created within it will never need gradients or be modified in-place
    dist.all_reduce performs an in-place operation - it modifies the input tensor directly by accumulating values from all processes. This in-place modification violates inference mode's guarantees
    Because inference mode is meant to provide performance optimizations by guaranteeing tensors won't be modified, PyTorch enforces this strictly - it won't allow you to modify an inference mode tensor even if you're outside the inference mode context
    solution: either use `t.no_grad()` instead, or wrap the all_reduce operation in a `with t.inference_mode(False):` block

    (meme - zero grad being the gun just domes the guy, like linux vs windows shutdown?)

Some more notes:

- batch_size in the DataLoader represents the per-GPU batch size; the effective batch size is batch_size * world_size
- the data shuffling works by giving each GPU a different subset of the data
- Calling `set_epoch` is necessary to make shuffling work properly across multiple epochs
- Make sure you aggregate accuracy, otherwise you might underestimate it by half!
- We recommend you print output rather than using tqdm, because tqdm can be a bit buggy especially in distributed settings




(put this somewhere earlier in the material)

The general recommendation is:

For SGD: Use linear scaling
For adaptive optimizers: Keep original rate or increase by less than 2x




btw we recommend using at least 4 GPUs for this exercise, because with just 2 the speed gain from dist might not significantly
outweight the speed cost of all the synchronization operations. Using 4+ is ideal!

do we break up the eval step across batches? in general no because this section isn't a bottleneck, and so the amount you're saving from parallelizing the computation might be outweighed by the overhead of synchronization. you can try it though (e.g. using `dist.all_reduce` or your implementation of all_reduce above, to get the total number of correct predictions across all processes and then aggregate them).

How do we use these gradients to update our parameters in a way which decreases loss?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1YuGKE8oy-Cx"},"source":["A loss function can be any differentiable function such that we prefer a lower value. To apply gradient descent, we start by initializing the parameters to random values (the details of this are subtle), and then repeatedly compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters. It [can be proven](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx) that for an infinitesimal step, moving in the direction of the gradient would increase the loss by the largest amount out of all possible directions.\n","\n","We actually want to decrease the loss, so we subtract the gradient to go in the opposite direction. Taking infinitesimal steps is no good, so we pick some learning rate $\\lambda$ (also called the step size) and scale our step by that amount to obtain the update rule for gradient descent:\n","\n","$$\\theta_t \\leftarrow \\theta_{t-1} - \\lambda \\nabla L(\\theta_{t-1})$$\n","\n","We know that an infinitesimal step will decrease the loss, but a finite step will only do so if the loss function is linear enough in the neighbourhood of the current parameters. If the loss function is too curved, we might actually increase our loss.\n","\n","The biggest advantage of this algorithm is that for N bytes of parameters, you only need N additional bytes of memory to store the gradients, which are of the same shape as the parameters. GPU memory is very limited, so this is an extremely relevant consideration. The amount of computation needed is also minimal: one multiply and one add per parameter.\n","\n","The biggest disadvantage is that we're completely ignoring the curvature of the loss function, not captured by the gradient consisting of partial derivatives. Intuitively, we can take a larger step if the loss function is flat in some direction or a smaller step if it is very curved. Generally, you could represent this by some matrix P that pre-multiplies the gradients to rescale them to account for the curvature. $P$ is called a preconditioner, and gradient descent is equivalent to approximating $P$ by an identity matrix, which is a very bad approximation.\n","\n","Most competing optimizers can be interpreted as trying to do something more sensible for $P$, subject to the constraint that GPU memory is at a premium. In particular, constructing $P$ explicitly is infeasible, since it's an $N \\times N$ matrix and N can be hundreds of billions. One idea is to use a diagonal $P$, which only requires N additional memory.

To be technical, there are three variations:\n","\n","- Batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss over the entire dataset. This requires too much computation unless the dataset is small, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n","- Stochastic gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a randomly selected example. Any particular loss may be completely in the wrong direction of the loss on the entire dataset, but in expectation it's in the right direction. This has some nice properties but doesn't parallelize well, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n","- Mini-batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a batch of examples of size `batch_size`. This is the standard in deep learning.\n","\n","The class `torch.optim.SGD` can be used for any of these by varying the number of examples passed in. We will be using only mini-batch gradient descent in this course.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lStatNS0zC81"},"source":["## Batch Size\n","\n","In addition to choosing a learning rate or learning rate schedule, we need to choose the batch size or batch size schedule as well. Intuitively, using a larger batch means that the estimate of the gradient is closer to that of the true gradient over the entire dataset, but this requires more compute. Each element of the batch can be computed in parallel so with sufficient compute, one can increase the batch size without increasing wall-clock time. For small-scale experiments, a good heuristic is thus \"fill up all of your GPU memory\".\n","\n","At a larger scale, we would expect diminishing returns of increasing the batch size, but empirically it's worse than that - a batch size that is too large generalizes more poorly in many scenarios. The intuition that a closer approximation to the true gradient is always better is therefore incorrect. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) for one discussion of this.\n","\n","For a batch size schedule, most commonly you'll see batch sizes increase over the course of training. The intuition is that a rough estimate of the proper direction is good enough early in training, but later in training it's important to preserve our progress and not \"bounce around\" too much.\n","\n","You will commonly see batch sizes that are a multiple of 32. One motivation for this is that when using CUDA, threads are grouped into \"warps\" of 32 threads which execute the same instructions in parallel. So a batch size of 64 would allow two warps to be fully utilized, whereas a size of 65 would require waiting for a third warp to finish. As batch sizes become larger, this wastage becomes less important.\n","\n","Powers of two are also common - the idea here is that work can be recursively divided up among different GPUs or within a GPU. For example, a matrix multiplication can be expressed by recursively dividing each matrix into four equal blocks and performing eight smaller matrix multiplications between the blocks.\n","\n","In tomorrow's exercises, you'll have the option to expore batch sizes in more detail.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hd-T_cE3zE1r"},"source":["## Common Themes in Gradient-Based Optimizers\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7hiWAagtzJxM"},"source":["### Weight Decay\n","\n","Weight decay means that on each iteration, in addition to a regular step, we also shrink each parameter very slightly towards 0 by multiplying a scaling factor close to 1, e.g. 0.9999.

This is an example of \"**inductive bias**\" - we make an assumption that helps us in the case where it's justified, and hurts us in the case where it's not justified.\n","\n","For a `Linear` layer, it's common practice to apply weight decay only to the weight and not the bias. It's also common to not apply weight decay to the parameters of a batch normalization layer. Again, there is empirical evidence (such as [Jai et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf)) and there are heuristic arguments to justify these choices, but no rigorous proofs.

It should be like the [PyTorch version](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html#torch.optim.SGD), but assume `nesterov=False`, `maximize=False`, and `dampening=0`. These simplifications mean that there are many variables in the pseudocode at that link which you can ignore.\n","\n","A few notes and tips (most of these apply to all the implementations, not just SGD):\n","\n","- The values $\\theta_t$ in this pseudocode represent each of the parameters within the list `params`, and the values $g_t$ represent the gradients.\n","- When you zero the gradients, you'll need to iterate over all parameters in `params` and set the gradient to a tensor of zeros (or just to `None`; this has the same effect since PyTorch automatically replaces `grad=None` with a tensor of zeros during backprop).\n","- Your step function shouldn't modify the gradients. This is why we have the decorator `@torch.inference_mode()` (which is equivalent to using the context manager `with torch.inference_mode():`). This is similar to `torch.no_grad`; the difference between them isn't worth getting into here but in general know that `torch.inference_mode` is mostly preferred.\n","- If you create any new tensors, they should be on the same device as the corresponding parameter. Use functions like `torch.zeros_like()` for this (which create tensors of the same shape, device and datatype).\n","- Be careful not to mix up `Parameter` and `Tensor` types in this step. The parameters in `params` are of type `Parameter`, but each `param.grad` should be of type `Tensor`.\n","\n","This is a challenging exercise, so we strongly recommend using the hints (STEP 1 and STEP 2) below.

We also define a dictionary called `logged_variables`, which we'll use to store the loss and accuracy at each step.\n","* The `to_device` method is a helper function, to move our data to the right device (this is a common cause of errors!).\n","* The `training_step` method performs a single gradient update step on a single batch of data, and returns the loss.\n","* The `validation_step` method performs a single evaluation of a batch of data, and returns number of correct classifications.\n","    * Note the use of the decorator `torch.inference_mode()` for this method, which stops gradients propagating.\n","* The `train` method repeatedly calls `training_step` and `validation_step`, and logs the loss and accuracy at each step.\n","    * Note that we've called `model.train()` and `model.eval()` before the training and evaluation steps respectively. This is important because the model has BatchNorm layers, which behave differently in training vs eval mode (in our simple MLP, we didn't have this problem).\n","\n","Note that the optimizer has been defined to only update the parameters in the final layer of the model. This is a common strategy for fine-tuning pretrained models (especially image classifiers). The term for this is **feature extraction**. We've also used the function `get_resnet_for_feature_extraction`, which returns a version of the `ResNet34` model, but with this final layer replaced with a randomly initialized linear layer, with number of output features equal to `args.n_classes`.

I would recommend forgetting about grid search if you have more than 3 hyperparameters, which in deep learning is \"always\".\n","\n","A much better idea is for each hyperparameter, decide on a sampling distribution and then on each trial just sample a random value from that distribution. This is called **random search** and back in 2012, you could get a [publication](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) for this. The diagram below shows the main reason that random search outperforms grid search. Empirically, some hyperparameters matter more than others, and random search benefits from having tried more distinct values in the important dimensions, increasing the chances of finding a \"peak\" between the grid points.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/Fundamentals/main/images/grid_vs_random.png\" width=\"540\">\n","\n","\n","It's worth noting that both of these searches are vastly less efficient than gradient descent at finding optima - imagine if you could only train neural networks by randomly initializing them and checking the loss!

This is a correction to the original scaling laws paper: parameter count scales linearly with token budget for compute-optimal models, not ~quadratically. The difference comes from using a separately-tuned learning rate schedule for each token budget, rather than using a single training run to measure performance for every token budget. This highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning for measuring scaling law exponents.\n","\n","You don't have to read the entire paper, just skim the graphs. Don't worry if they don't all make sense yet (it will be more illuminating when we study LLMs next week). Note that, although it specifically applies to language models, the key underlying ideas of tradeoffs between optimal dataset size and model size are generally applicable.\n","\n","### Suggested exercise\n","\n","Perform your own study of scaling laws for MNIST.\n","\n","- Write a script to train a small CNN on MNIST, or find one you have written previously.\n","- Training for a single epoch only, vary the model size and dataset size. For the model size, multiply the width by powers of sqrt(2) (rounding if necessary - the idea is to vary the amount of compute used per forward pass by powers of 2). For the dataset size, multiply the fraction of the full dataset used by powers of 2 (i.e. 1, 1/2, 1/4, ...). To reduce noise, use a few random seeds and always use the full validation set.\n","- The learning rate will need to vary with model size. Either tune it carefully for each model size, or use the rule of thumb that for Adam, the learning rate should be proportional to the initialization scale, i.e. `1/sqrt(fan_in)` for the standard Kaiming He initialization (which is what PyTorch generally uses by default).\n","    - Note - `fan_in` refers to the variable $N_{in}$, which is `in_features` for a linear layer, and `in_channels * kernel_size * kernel_size` for a convolutional layer - in other words, the number of input parameters/activations we take a sumproduct over to get each output activation.\n","- Plot the amount of compute used (on a log scale) against validation loss. The compute-efficient frontier should follow an approximate power law (straight line on a log scale).\n","How does validation accuracy behave?\n","- Study how the compute-efficient model size varies with compute. This should also follow an approximate power law. Try to estimate its exponent.\n","- Repeat your entire experiment with 20% [dropout](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html) to see how this affects the scaling exponents.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CuxD5x8WKG7k"},"source":["## Other WandB features: Saving & Logging\n","\n","Here are a few more Weights & Biases features you might also want to play around with:\n","\n","* [Logging media and objects in experiments](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/log?fbclid=IwAR3NxKsGpEjZwq3vSwYkohZllMpBwxHgOCc_k0ByuD9XGUsi_Scf5ELvGsQ) - you'll be doing this during the RL week, and it's useful when you're training generative image models like VAEs and diffusion models.\n","* [Code saving](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/app/features/panels/code?fbclid=IwAR2BkaXbRf7cqEH8kc1VzqH_kOJWGxqjUb_JCBq_SCnXOx1oF-Rt-hHydb4) - this captures all python source code files in the current director and all subdirectories.

Good hyperparameters on the small model tend to transfer over to the larger model because the architecture and the data are the same; the main difference is the larger model may require more regularization to prevent overfitting.\n","    - Bad hyperparameters are usually clearly worse by the end of the first 1-2 epochs. If you can train for fewer epochs, you can test more hyperparameters with the same compute. You can manually abort runs that don't look promising, or you can try to do it automatically; [Hyperband](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf) is a popular algorithm for this.\n","    - Play with optimizations like [Automatic Mixed Precision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html) to see if you get a speed boost.\n","- Random search for a decent learning rate and batch size combination that allows your model to mostly memorize (overfit) the training set.\n","    - It's better to overfit at the start than underfit, because it means your model is capable of learning and has enough capacity.\n","    - Learning rate is often the most important single hyperparameter, so it's important to get a good-enough value early.\n","    - Eventually, you'll want a learning rate schedule. Usually, you'll start low and gradually increase, then gradually decrease but many other schedules are feasible. [Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/nn-learning-rate/) has a good blog post on learning rates.\n","    - Larger batch size increases GPU memory usage and doubling batch size [often allows doubling learning rate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf), up to a point where this relationship breaks down. The heuristic is that larger batches give a more accurate estimate of the direction to update in. Note that on the test set, you can vary the batch size independently and usually the largest value that will fit on your GPU will be the most efficient.\n","- Add regularization to reduce the amount of overfitting and train for longer to see if it's enough.\n","    - Data augmention is the first thing to do - flipping the image horizontally and Cutout are known to be effective.\n","    - Play with the label smoothing parameter to [torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html).\n","    - Try adding weight decay to Adam. This is a bit tricky - see this [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/) article if you want to do this, as well as the [PyTorch pseudocode](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.AdamW.html).\n","- Try a bit of architecture search: play with various numbers of blocks and block groups.

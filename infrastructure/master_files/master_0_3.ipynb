But for now, let's take it as read that calling `loss.backward()` on a scalar `loss` will result in the computation of the gradients $\\frac{\\partial loss}{\\partial w}$ for every parameter `w` in the model, and store these values in `w.grad`. How do we use these gradients to update our parameters in a way which decreases loss?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A loss function can be any differentiable function such that we prefer a lower value. To apply gradient descent, we start by initializing the parameters to random values (the details of this are subtle), and then repeatedly compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters. It [can be proven](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx) that for an infinitesimal step, moving in the direction of the gradient would increase the loss by the largest amount out of all possible directions.\n","\n","We actually want to decrease the loss, so we subtract the gradient to go in the opposite direction. Taking infinitesimal steps is no good, so we pick some learning rate $\\lambda$ (also called the step size) and scale our step by that amount to obtain the update rule for gradient descent:\n","\n","$$\\theta_t \\leftarrow \\theta_{t-1} - \\lambda \\nabla L(\\theta_{t-1})$$\n","\n","We know that an infinitesimal step will decrease the loss, but a finite step will only do so if the loss function is linear enough in the neighbourhood of the current parameters. If the loss function is too curved, we might actually increase our loss.\n","\n","The biggest advantage of this algorithm is that for N bytes of parameters, you only need N additional bytes of memory to store the gradients, which are of the same shape as the parameters. GPU memory is very limited, so this is an extremely relevant consideration. The amount of computation needed is also minimal: one multiply and one add per parameter.\n","\n","The biggest disadvantage is that we're completely ignoring the curvature of the loss function, not captured by the gradient consisting of partial derivatives. Intuitively, we can take a larger step if the loss function is flat in some direction or a smaller step if it is very curved. Generally, you could represent this by some matrix P that pre-multiplies the gradients to rescale them to account for the curvature. $P$ is called a preconditioner, and gradient descent is equivalent to approximating $P$ by an identity matrix, which is a very bad approximation.\n","\n","Most competing optimizers can be interpreted as trying to do something more sensible for $P$, subject to the constraint that GPU memory is at a premium. In particular, constructing $P$ explicitly is infeasible, since it's an $N \\times N$ matrix and N can be hundreds of billions. One idea is to use a diagonal $P$, which only requires N additional memory. An example of a more sophisticated scheme is [Shampoo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09568.pdf).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["> The algorithm is called **Shampoo** because you put shampoo on your hair before using conditioner, and this method is a pre-conditioner.\n",">     \n","> If you take away just one thing from this entire curriculum, please don't let it be this.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Stochastic Gradient Descent\n","\n","The terms gradient descent and SGD are used loosely in deep learning. To be technical, there are three variations:\n","\n","- Batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss over the entire dataset. This requires too much computation unless the dataset is small, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n","- Stochastic gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a randomly selected example. Any particular loss may be completely in the wrong direction of the loss on the entire dataset, but in expectation it's in the right direction. This has some nice properties but doesn't parallelize well, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n","- Mini-batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a batch of examples of size `batch_size`. This is the standard in deep learning.\n","\n","The class `torch.optim.SGD` can be used for any of these by varying the number of examples passed in. We will be using only mini-batch gradient descent in this course.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Batch Size\n","\n","In addition to choosing a learning rate or learning rate schedule, we need to choose the batch size or batch size schedule as well. Intuitively, using a larger batch means that the estimate of the gradient is closer to that of the true gradient over the entire dataset, but this requires more compute. Each element of the batch can be computed in parallel so with sufficient compute, one can increase the batch size without increasing wall-clock time. For small-scale experiments, a good heuristic is thus \"fill up all of your GPU memory\".\n","\n","At a larger scale, we would expect diminishing returns of increasing the batch size, but empirically it's worse than that - a batch size that is too large generalizes more poorly in many scenarios. The intuition that a closer approximation to the true gradient is always better is therefore incorrect. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) for one discussion of this.\n","\n","For a batch size schedule, most commonly you'll see batch sizes increase over the course of training. The intuition is that a rough estimate of the proper direction is good enough early in training, but later in training it's important to preserve our progress and not \"bounce around\" too much.\n","\n","You will commonly see batch sizes that are a multiple of 32. One motivation for this is that when using CUDA, threads are grouped into \"warps\" of 32 threads which execute the same instructions in parallel. So a batch size of 64 would allow two warps to be fully utilized, whereas a size of 65 would require waiting for a third warp to finish. As batch sizes become larger, this wastage becomes less important.\n","\n","Powers of two are also common - the idea here is that work can be recursively divided up among different GPUs or within a GPU. For example, a matrix multiplication can be expressed by recursively dividing each matrix into four equal blocks and performing eight smaller matrix multiplications between the blocks.\n","\n","In tomorrow's exercises, you'll have the option to expore batch sizes in more detail.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Common Themes in Gradient-Based Optimizers\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Weight Decay\n","\n","Weight decay means that on each iteration, in addition to a regular step, we also shrink each parameter very slightly towards 0 by multiplying a scaling factor close to 1, e.g. 0.9999. Empirically, this seems to help but there are no proofs that apply to deep neural networks.\n","\n","In the case of linear regression, weight decay is mathematically equivalent to having a prior that each parameter is Gaussian distributed - in other words it's very unlikely that the true parameter values are very positive or very negative. This is an example of \"**inductive bias**\" - we make an assumption that helps us in the case where it's justified, and hurts us in the case where it's not justified.\n","\n","For a `Linear` layer, it's common practice to apply weight decay only to the weight and not the bias. It's also common to not apply weight decay to the parameters of a batch normalization layer. Again, there is empirical evidence (such as [Jai et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf)) and there are heuristic arguments to justify these choices, but no rigorous proofs.

It should be like the [PyTorch version](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.SGD.html#torch.optim.SGD), but assume `nesterov=False`, `maximize=False`, and `dampening=0`. These simplifications mean that there are many variables in the pseudocode at that link which you can ignore.\n","\n","A few notes and tips (most of these apply to all the implementations, not just SGD):\n","\n","- The values $\\theta_t$ in this pseudocode represent each of the parameters within the list `params`, and the values $g_t$ represent the gradients.\n","- When you zero the gradients, you'll need to iterate over all parameters in `params` and set the gradient to a tensor of zeros (or just to `None`; this has the same effect since PyTorch automatically replaces `grad=None` with a tensor of zeros during backprop).\n","- Your step function shouldn't modify the gradients. This is why we have the decorator `@torch.inference_mode()` (which is equivalent to using the context manager `with torch.inference_mode():`). This is similar to `torch.no_grad`; the difference between them isn't worth getting into here but in general know that `torch.inference_mode` is mostly preferred.\n","- If you create any new tensors, they should be on the same device as the corresponding parameter. Use functions like `torch.zeros_like()` for this (which create tensors of the same shape, device and datatype).\n","- Be careful not to mix up `Parameter` and `Tensor` types in this step. The parameters in `params` are of type `Parameter`, but each `param.grad` should be of type `Tensor`.\n","\n","This is a challenging exercise, so we strongly recommend using the hints (STEP 1 and STEP 2) below.

There are many papers saying that in certain situations, SGD (with momentum) generalizes better, where Adam often tends to overfit.

Previously, we just used a single `train` function which took a dataclass as argument. But this resulted in a very long function with many nested loops and some repeated code.

This is important because the model has BatchNorm layers, which behave differently in training vs eval mode (in our simple MLP, we didn't have this problem).\n","\n","Note that the optimizer has been defined to only update the parameters in the final layer of the model. This is a common strategy for fine-tuning pretrained models (especially image classifiers). The term for this is **feature extraction**. We've also used the function `get_resnet_for_feature_extraction`, which returns a version of the `ResNet34` model, but with this final layer replaced with a randomly initialized linear layer, with number of output features equal to `args.n_classes`.

What is Weights and Biases?\n","\n","Weights and Biases is a cloud service that allows you to log data from experiments. Your logged data is shown in graphs during training, and you can easily compare logs across different runs. It also allows you to run **sweeps**, where you can specifiy a distribution over hyperparameters and then start a sequence of test runs which use hyperparameters sampled from this distribution.\n","\n","Before you run any of the code below, you should visit the [Weights and Biases homepage](https://wandb.ai/home), and create your own account.\n","\n","We'll be able to keep the same structure of training loop when using weights and biases, we'll just have to add a few functions.

It should be called once, at the start of your training loop.\n","\n","A few important arguments are:\n","\n","* `project` - the name of the project where you're sending the new run. For example, this could be `'day3-resnet'` for us. You can have many different runs in each project.\n","* `name` - a display name for this run. By default, if this isn't supplied, wandb generates a random 2-word name for you (e.g. `gentle-sunflower-42`).\n","* `config` - a dictionary containing hyperparameters for this run. If you pass this dictionary, then you can compare different runs' hyperparameters & results in a single table. Alternatively, you can pass a dataclass.\n","\n","#### `wandb.watch`\n","\n","This function tells wandb to watch a model - this means that it will log the gradients and parameters of the model during training. We'll call this function once, after we've created our model. The 3 most important arguments are:\n","\n","* `models`, which is a module or list of modules. You can pass the entire model, or just a submodule e.g. `wandb.watch(self.model.some_layer)` if you only want to log gradients & values for a specific part of the model.\n","* `log`, which can take the value `'gradients'`, `'parameters'`, or `'all'`, and which determines what gets tracked. Default is `'gradients'`.\n","* `log_freq`, which is an integer. Logging happens once every `log_freq` batches. Default is 1000.\n","\n","Why do we log parameters and gradients? Mainly this is [helpful for debugging](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/articles/reports/Debugging-Neural-Networks-with-PyTorch-and-W-B-Using-Gradients-and-Visualizations--Vmlldzo1NDQxNTA5), because it helps us identify problems like exploding or vanishing gradients, dead ReLUs, etc.\n","\n","#### `wandb.log`\n","\n","For logging metrics to the wandb dashboard. This is used as `wandb.log(data, step)`, where `step` is an integer (the x-axis on your metric plots) and `data` is a dictionary of metrics (i.e. the keys are metric names, and the values are metric values).\n","\n","#### `wandb.finish`\n","\n","This function should be called at the end of your training loop.

At times this is more of an art than a science, because frequently rules and heuristics which work most of the time will break down in certain special cases. For example, a common heuristic for number of workers in a `DataLoader` is to set them to be 4 times the number of GPUs you have available (see later sections on distributed computing for more on this). However, setting these values too high can lead to issues where your CPU is bottlenecked by the workers and your epochs take a long time to start - it took me a long time to realize this was happening when I was initially writing these exercises!\n","\n","Sweeping over hyperparameters (which we'll cover shortly) can help remove some of the difficulty here, because you can use sweep methods that guide you towards an optimal set of hyperparameter choices rather than having to manually pick your own. However, here are a few heuristics that you might find useful in a variety of situations:\n","\n","- **Setting batch size**\n","    - Generally you should aim to **saturate your GPU** with data - this means choosing a batch size that's as large as possible without causing memory errors\n","        - You should generally aim for over 70% utilization of your GPU\n","    - Note, this means you should generally try for a larger batch size in your testloader than your trainloader (because evaluation is done without gradients, and so a smaller memory constraint)\n","        - A good starting point is 4x the size, but this will vary between models\n","- **Choosing a learning rate**\n","    - Inspecting loss curves can be a good way of evaluating our learning rate\n","        - If loss is decreasing very slowly & monotonically then this is a sign you should increase the learning rate, whereas very large LR spikes are a sign that you should decrease it\n","    - A common strategy is **warmup**, i.e. having a smaller learning rate for a short period of time at the start of training - we'll do this a lot in later material\n","    - [Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/nn-learning-rate/) has a good blog post on learning rates\n","- **Balancing learning rate and batch size**\n","    - For standard optimizers like `SGD`, it's a good idea to scale the learning rate inversely to the batch size - this way the variance of each parameter step remains the same\n","    - However for **adaptive optimizers** such as `Adam` (where the size of parameter updates automatically adjusts based on the first and second moments of our gradients), this isn't as necessary\n","        - This is why we generally start with default parameters for Adam, and then adjust from there\n","- **Misc. advice**\n","    - If you're training a larger model, it's sometimes a good idea to start with a smaller version of that same model. Good hyperparameters tend to transfer if the architecture & data is the same; the main difference is the larger model may require more regularization to prevent overfitting.\n","    - Bad hyperparameters are usually clearly worse by the end of the first 1-2 epochs. You can manually abort runs that don't look promising (or do it automatically - see discussion of Hyperband in wandb sweeps at the end of this section)\n","    - Overfitting at the start is better than underfitting, because it means your model is capable of learning and has enough capacity\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Hyperparameter search\n","\n","One way to search for good hyperparameters is to choose a set of values for each hyperparameter, and then search all combinations of those specific values. This is called **grid search**. The values don't need to be evenly spaced and you can incorporate any knowledge you have about plausible values from similar problems to choose the set of values. Searching the product of sets takes exponential time, so is really only feasible if there are a small number of hyperparameters. I would recommend forgetting about grid search if you have more than 3 hyperparameters, which in deep learning is \"always\".\n","\n","A much better idea is for each hyperparameter, decide on a sampling distribution and then on each trial just sample a random value from that distribution. This is called **random search** and back in 2012, you could get a [publication](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) for this. The diagram below shows the main reason that random search outperforms grid search. Empirically, some hyperparameters matter more than others, and random search benefits from having tried more distinct values in the important dimensions, increasing the chances of finding a \"peak\" between the grid points.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/Fundamentals/main/images/grid_vs_random.png\" width=\"540\">\n","\n","\n","It's worth noting that both of these searches are vastly less efficient than gradient descent at finding optima - imagine if you could only train neural networks by randomly initializing them and checking the loss!

While distributed training can be used for any type of ML model training, it is most beneficial to use it for large models and compute demanding tasks as deep learning.\n","\n","There are 2 main families of distributed training methods: **data parallelism** and **model parallelism**. In data parallelism, we split batches of data across different processes, run forward & backward passes on each separately, and accumulate the gradients to update the model parameters. In model parallelism, the model is segmented into different parts that can run concurrently in different nodes, and each one runs on the same data. Model parallelism further splits into horizontal and vertical parallelism depending on whether we're splitting the model up into sequential or parallel parts. Most often horizontal parallelism is called **tensor parallelism** (because it involves splitting up the weights in a single layer across multiple GPUs, into what we commonly call **sharded weights**), and vertical parallelism is called **pipeline parallelism**.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/parallelism.png\" width=\"1100\">\n","\n","Data & model parallelism are both widely used, and can be more or less appropriate in different circumstances (e.g. some kind of model parallelism is necessary when your model is too large to fit on a single GPU).

You should also filter for number of GPUs: we recommend 4x or 8x. You can do this using the options menu at the very top of the list of machines. Lastly, we recommend filtering for a decent PCIE Bandwidth (e.g. at least 20GB/s) - this is important for efficient gradient sychronization between GPUs. We're training a small model today: approx 22m parameters, which translates to ~88MB total size of weights, and so we'll transfer 88MB of data between GPUs per process (since we're transferring the model's gradients, which have the same size as the weights). We don't want this to be a bottleneck, which is why we should filter for this bandwidth.\n","\n","Once you've filtered for this, we recommend picking an RTX 3090 or 4090 machine. These won't be as powerful as an A100, but the purpose today is more to illustrate the basic ideas behind distributed training than to push your model training to its limits.

This is a correction to the original scaling laws paper: parameter count scales linearly with token budget for compute-optimal models, not ~quadratically. The difference comes from using a separately-tuned learning rate schedule for each token budget, rather than using a single training run to measure performance for every token budget. This highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning for measuring scaling law exponents.\n","\n","You don't have to read the entire paper, just skim the graphs. Don't worry if they don't all make sense yet (it will be more illuminating when we study LLMs next week). Note that, although it specifically applies to language models, the key underlying ideas of tradeoffs between optimal dataset size and model size are generally applicable.\n","\n","### Suggested exercise\n","\n","Perform your own study of scaling laws for MNIST.\n","\n","- Write a script to train a small CNN on MNIST, or find one you have written previously.\n","- Training for a single epoch only, vary the model size and dataset size. For the model size, multiply the width by powers of sqrt(2) (rounding if necessary - the idea is to vary the amount of compute used per forward pass by powers of 2). For the dataset size, multiply the fraction of the full dataset used by powers of 2 (i.e. 1, 1/2, 1/4, ...). To reduce noise, use a few random seeds and always use the full validation set.\n","- The learning rate will need to vary with model size. Either tune it carefully for each model size, or use the rule of thumb that for Adam, the learning rate should be proportional to the initialization scale, i.e. `1/sqrt(fan_in)` for the standard Kaiming He initialization (which is what PyTorch generally uses by default).\n","    - Note - `fan_in` refers to the variable $N_{in}$, which is `in_features` for a linear layer, and `in_channels * kernel_size * kernel_size` for a convolutional layer - in other words, the number of input parameters/activations we take a sumproduct over to get each output activation.\n","- Plot the amount of compute used (on a log scale) against validation loss. The compute-efficient frontier should follow an approximate power law (straight line on a log scale).\n","How does validation accuracy behave?\n","- Study how the compute-efficient model size varies with compute.

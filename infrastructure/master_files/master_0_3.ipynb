In data parallelism, we split batches of data across different processes, run forward & backward passes on each separately, and accumulate the gradients to update the model parameters. In model parallelism, the model is segmented into different parts that can run concurrently in different nodes, and each one runs on the same data. Model parallelism further splits into horizontal and vertical parallelism depending on whether we're splitting the model up into sequential or parallel parts. Most often horizontal parallelism is called **tensor parallelism** (because it involves splitting up the weights in a single layer across multiple GPUs, into what we commonly call **sharded weights**), and vertical parallelism is called **pipeline parallelism**.\n", "\n", "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/parallelism.png\" width=\"1100\">\n", "\n", "Data & model parallelism are both widely used, and can be more or less appropriate in different circumstances (e.g. some kind of model parallelism is necessary when your model is too large to fit on a single GPU).

Lastly, we recommend filtering for a decent PCIE Bandwidth (e.g. at least 20GB/s) - this is important for efficient gradient sychronization between GPUs. We're training a small model today: approx 22m parameters, which translates to ~88MB total size of weights, and so we'll transfer 88MB of data between GPUs per process (since we're transferring the model's gradients, which have the same size as the weights).

For the model size, multiply the width by powers of sqrt(2) (rounding if necessary - the idea is to vary the amount of compute used per forward pass by powers of 2). For the dataset size, multiply the fraction of the full dataset used by powers of 2 (i.e. 1, 1/2, 1/4, ...). To reduce noise, use a few random seeds and always use the full validation set.\n", "- The learning rate will need to vary with model size.

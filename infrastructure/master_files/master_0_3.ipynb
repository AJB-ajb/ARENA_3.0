But for now, let's take it as read that calling `loss.backward()` on a scalar `loss` will result in the computation of the gradients $\\frac{\\partial loss}{\\partial w}$ for every parameter `w` in the model, and store these values in `w.grad`. How do we use these gradients to update our parameters in a way which decreases loss?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["A loss function can be any differentiable function such that we prefer a lower value. To apply gradient descent, we start by initializing the parameters to random values (the details of this are subtle), and then repeatedly compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters. It [can be proven](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx) that for an infinitesimal step, moving in the direction of the gradient would increase the loss by the largest amount out of all possible directions.\n","\n","We actually want to decrease the loss, so we subtract the gradient to go in the opposite direction. Taking infinitesimal steps is no good, so we pick some learning rate $\\lambda$ (also called the step size) and scale our step by that amount to obtain the update rule for gradient descent:\n","\n","$$\\theta_t \\leftarrow \\theta_{t-1} - \\lambda \\nabla L(\\theta_{t-1})$$\n","\n","We know that an infinitesimal step will decrease the loss, but a finite step will only do so if the loss function is linear enough in the neighbourhood of the current parameters. If the loss function is too curved, we might actually increase our loss.\n","\n","The biggest advantage of this algorithm is that for N bytes of parameters, you only need N additional bytes of memory to store the gradients, which are of the same shape as the parameters. GPU memory is very limited, so this is an extremely relevant consideration. The amount of computation needed is also minimal: one multiply and one add per parameter.\n","\n","The biggest disadvantage is that we're completely ignoring the curvature of the loss function, not captured by the gradient consisting of partial derivatives. Intuitively, we can take a larger step if the loss function is flat in some direction or a smaller step if it is very curved. Generally, you could represent this by some matrix P that pre-multiplies the gradients to rescale them to account for the curvature. $P$ is called a preconditioner, and gradient descent is equivalent to approximating $P$ by an identity matrix, which is a very bad approximation.\n","\n","Most competing optimizers can be interpreted as trying to do something more sensible for $P$, subject to the constraint that GPU memory is at a premium. In particular, constructing $P$ explicitly is infeasible, since it's an $N \\times N$ matrix and N can be hundreds of billions. One idea is to use a diagonal $P$, which only requires N additional memory.

To be technical, there are three variations:\n","\n","- Batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss over the entire dataset. This requires too much computation unless the dataset is small, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n","- Stochastic gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a randomly selected example. Any particular loss may be completely in the wrong direction of the loss on the entire dataset, but in expectation it's in the right direction. This has some nice properties but doesn't parallelize well, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n","- Mini-batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a batch of examples of size `batch_size`. This is the standard in deep learning.\n","\n","The class `torch.optim.SGD` can be used for any of these by varying the number of examples passed in. We will be using only mini-batch gradient descent in this course.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Batch Size\n","\n","In addition to choosing a learning rate or learning rate schedule, we need to choose the batch size or batch size schedule as well. Intuitively, using a larger batch means that the estimate of the gradient is closer to that of the true gradient over the entire dataset, but this requires more compute. Each element of the batch can be computed in parallel so with sufficient compute, one can increase the batch size without increasing wall-clock time. For small-scale experiments, a good heuristic is thus \"fill up all of your GPU memory\".\n","\n","At a larger scale, we would expect diminishing returns of increasing the batch size, but empirically it's worse than that - a batch size that is too large generalizes more poorly in many scenarios. The intuition that a closer approximation to the true gradient is always better is therefore incorrect. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) for one discussion of this.\n","\n","For a batch size schedule, most commonly you'll see batch sizes increase over the course of training. The intuition is that a rough estimate of the proper direction is good enough early in training, but later in training it's important to preserve our progress and not \"bounce around\" too much.\n","\n","You will commonly see batch sizes that are a multiple of 32. One motivation for this is that when using CUDA, threads are grouped into \"warps\" of 32 threads which execute the same instructions in parallel. So a batch size of 64 would allow two warps to be fully utilized, whereas a size of 65 would require waiting for a third warp to finish. As batch sizes become larger, this wastage becomes less important.\n","\n","Powers of two are also common - the idea here is that work can be recursively divided up among different GPUs or within a GPU. For example, a matrix multiplication can be expressed by recursively dividing each matrix into four equal blocks and performing eight smaller matrix multiplications between the blocks.\n","\n","In tomorrow's exercises, you'll have the option to expore batch sizes in more detail.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Common Themes in Gradient-Based Optimizers\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Weight Decay\n","\n","Weight decay means that on each iteration, in addition to a regular step, we also shrink each parameter very slightly towards 0 by multiplying a scaling factor close to 1, e.g. 0.9999. Empirically, this seems to help but there are no proofs that apply to deep neural networks.\n","\n","In the case of linear regression, weight decay is mathematically equivalent to having a prior that each parameter is Gaussian distributed - in other words it's very unlikely that the true parameter values are very positive or very negative. This is an example of \"**inductive bias**\" - we make an assumption that helps us in the case where it's justified, and hurts us in the case where it's not justified.\n","\n","For a `Linear` layer, it's common practice to apply weight decay only to the weight and not the bias. It's also common to not apply weight decay to the parameters of a batch normalization layer. Again, there is empirical evidence (such as [Jai et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf)) and there are heuristic arguments to justify these choices, but no rigorous proofs.

While distributed training can be used for any type of ML model training, it is most beneficial to use it for large models and compute demanding tasks as deep learning.\n","\n","There are 2 main families of distributed training methods: **data parallelism** and **model parallelism**. In data parallelism, we split batches of data across different processes, run forward & backward passes on each separately, and accumulate the gradients to update the model parameters. In model parallelism, the model is segmented into different parts that can run concurrently in different nodes, and each one runs on the same data. Model parallelism further splits into horizontal and vertical parallelism depending on whether we're splitting the model up into sequential or parallel parts. Most often horizontal parallelism is called **tensor parallelism** (because it involves splitting up the weights in a single layer across multiple GPUs, into what we commonly call **sharded weights**), and vertical parallelism is called **pipeline parallelism**.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/parallelism.png\" width=\"1100\">\n","\n","Data & model parallelism are both widely used, and can be more or less appropriate in different circumstances (e.g. some kind of model parallelism is necessary when your model is too large to fit on a single GPU). However it is possible to create hybrid forms of parallelism by combining these; this is especially common when training large models like current SOTA LLMs. In these exercises, we'll focus on just data parallelism, although we'll suggest a few bonus exercises that explore model parallelism."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Summary of exercises\n","\n","The exercises below will take you through **data parallelism**. You'll start by learning how to use the basic send and receive functions in PyTorch's distributed training module `torch.distributed` to transfer tensors between different processes (and different GPUs). Note that **you'll need multiple GPUs for these exercises** - we've included instructions in a dropdown below.\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Getting multiple GPUs</summary>\n","\n","The instructions for booting up a machine from vastai can already be found on the Streamlit homepage (i.e. navigate to \"Home\" on the sidebar, then to the section \"Virtual Machines\"). The only extra thing you'll need to do here is filter for an appropriate machine type.\n","\n","We recommend filtering for \"Disk Space To Allocate\" (i.e. the primary slider on the top of the filter menu) of at least 40GB, not for the model (which is actually quite small) but for installing the ARENA dependencies. You should also filter for number of GPUs: we recommend 4x or 8x. You can do this using the options menu at the very top of the list of machines. Lastly, we recommend filtering for a decent PCIE Bandwidth (e.g. at least 20GB/s) - this is important for efficient gradient sychronization between GPUs. We're training a small model today: approx 22m parameters, which translates to ~88MB total size of weights, and so we'll transfer 88MB of data between GPUs per process (since we're transferring the model's gradients, which have the same size as the weights). We don't want this to be a bottleneck, which is why we should filter for this bandwidth.\n","\n","Once you've filtered for this, we recommend picking an RTX 3090 or 4090 machine. These won't be as powerful as an A100, but the purpose today is more to illustrate the basic ideas behind distributed training than to push your model training to its limits. Note that if you were using an A100 then you should filter for a high NVLink Bandwidth rather than PCIE (since A100s use NVLink instead of PCIE).\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","Once you've done this, you'll use those 2 primitive point-to-point functions to build up some more advanced functions: `broadcast` (which gets a tensor from one process to all others), `gather` (which gathers all tensors from different devices to a single device) and `all_reduce` (which combines both `broadcast` and `gather` to make aggregate tensor values across all processes). These functions (`all_reduce` in particular) are key parts of how distributed computing works.\n","\n","Lastly, you'll learn how to use these functions to build a distributed training loop, which will be adapted from the `ResNetTrainer` code from your previous exercises. We also explain how you can use `DistributedDataParallel` to abstract away these low-level operations, which you might find useful later on (although you will benefit from building these components up from scratch, and understanding how they work under the hood)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Running these exercises\n","\n","If you've been working in a notebook, you'll need to switch over to a Python file now.

For each worker, we create a new Python interpreter (called a \"child process\") which will execute the function passed to `mp.spawn` (which in this case is `send_receive`). The function has to have the type signature `fn(rank, *args)` where `args` is the tuple we pass into `mp.spawn()`. The total number of processes is determined by `world_size`. Note that this isn't the same as the number of GPUs - in fact, in the code below we've not moved any of our data to GPUs, we're just using the distributed API to sync data across multiple processes. We'll introduce GPUs in the code below this!\n","\n","We require the environment variables `MASTER_ADDR` and `MASTER_PORT` to be set before launching & communicating between processes. The former specifies the IP address or hostname of the machine that will act as the central coordinator (the \"master\" node) for setting up and managing the distributed environment, while the latter specifies the port number that the master node will use for communication. In our case we're running all our processes from a single node, so all we need is for this to be an unused port on our machine.\n","\n","Now, breaking down the `send_receive` function line by line:\n","\n","- `dist.init_process_group` initializes each process with a common address and port, and a communication backend. It also gives each process a unique rank, so they know who is sending & receiving data.\n","- If the function is being run by rank 0, then we create a tensor of zeros and send it using `dist.send`.\n","- If the function is being run by rank 1, then we create a tensor of ones and wait to receive a tensor from rank 0 using `dist.recv`. This will overwrite the data in the original tensor that we created, i.e. so we're just left with a tensor of zeros.\n","- `dist.destroy_process_group()` is called at the end of the function to destroy the process group and release resources.\n","\n","The functions `dist.send` and `dist.recv` are the basic primitives for point-to-point communication between processes (we'll look at the primitives for collective communication later on). Each `recv` for a given source process `src` will wait until it receives a `send` from that source to continue, and likewise each `send` to a given destination process `dst` will wait until it receives a `recv` from that process to continue.

Parameters are a special class wrapping around and extending standard PyTorch tensors - we'll look at this in more detail tomorrow!\n","2. **Parameter syncing after each training step**\n","    - After each `loss.backward()` call but before stepping with the optimizer, you'll need to use `all_reduce` to sync gradients across each parameter in the model.\n","    - Just like in the example we gave above, calling `all_reduce` on `param.grad` should work, because `.grad` is a standard PyTorch tensor.\n","3. **Trainloader sampling at each epoch**\n","    - Distributed training works by splitting each batch of data across all the running processes, and so we need to implement this by splitting each batch randomly across our GPUs.\n","\n","For (3), we've given you some sample code that implements this below. Note that each pair of tensors in `train_loader` will contain `self.args.batch_size` examples, meaning our effective batch size is actually `self.args.batch_size * world_size`. If we were using a standard optimizer like SGD then we'd want to adjust the learning rate accordingly (higher batch size = higher learning rate, so the variance of updates is balanced), but for adaptive optimizers like Adam this generally isn't necessary.\n","\n","```python\n","# `__init__` method: Create sampler & loader during initialization\n","self.train_sampler = torch.utils.data.DistributedSampler(self.trainset, num_replicas=args.world_size, rank=self.rank)\n","self.train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(\n","    self.trainset,\n","    self.args.batch_size,\n","    sampler=self.train_sampler,  # passing the sampler into the trainloader\n","    num_workers=2,  # setting this low so as not to risk bottlenecking CPU resources\n","    pin_memory=True,  # this can improve data transfer speed between CPU and GPU\n",")\n","\n","# `train` method: make sure to set the epoch for the sampler:\n","self.train_sampler.set_epoch(epoch)\n","for imgs, labels in self.train_loader:\n","    ...\n","```\n","\n","We also recommend that you play around with the dataloader parameters like `num_workers` and `pin_memory` to see if you can get improvements. There are some general heuristics to follow (e.g. `num_workers = 4 * num_gpus` is a common starting point), but a high number of workers can also compete for CPU resources and slow down your training (epochs taking a long time to start is a sign of this happening). The details of this will vary depending on your hardware, so you'll have to experiment!\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Why don't we distribute the evaluation step across GPUs too?</summary>\n","\n","This is an option, and you could implement it by e.g. computing both the number of correct predictions and total number of predictions made in each process then using `all_reduce` once to aggregate these values and give us a single accuracy score.\n","\n","The main reason we don't do it is that the evaluation step usually shouldn't be a bottleneck for your training process, so it's not a big deal if it's not distributed. Evaluation usually involves a much smaller dataset, and also is done with gradients disabled & no backpropagation which makes it much faster than our training steps. If the evaluation step is a bottleneck for you, this is more likely a red flag indicating that you should be implementing this step differently, e.g. a smaller validation set.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","We've given you the function `dist_train_resnet_from_scratch` which you'll be able to pass into `mp.spawn` just like the examples above.

To reduce noise, use a few random seeds and always use the full validation set.\n","- The learning rate will need to vary with model size. Either tune it carefully for each model size, or use the rule of thumb that for Adam, the learning rate should be proportional to the initialization scale, i.e. `1/sqrt(fan_in)` for the standard Kaiming He initialization (which is what PyTorch generally uses by default).\n","    - Note - `fan_in` refers to the variable $N_{in}$, which is `in_features` for a linear layer, and `in_channels * kernel_size * kernel_size` for a convolutional layer - in other words, the number of input parameters/activations we take a sumproduct over to get each output activation.\n","- Plot the amount of compute used (on a log scale) against validation loss.

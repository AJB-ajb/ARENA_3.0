This section is designed to get you familiar with basic neural networks: how they are structured, the basic operations like linear layers and convolutions which go into making them, and why they work as well as they do. You'll start by making very simple neural networks, and by the end of today you'll build up to assembling ResNet34, a comparatively much more complicated architecture.

## Content & Learning Objectives

### 1️⃣ Making your own modules

In the first set of exercises, we'll cover the general structure of modules in PyTorch. You'll also implement your own basic modules, including for ReLU and Linear layers. You'll finish by assembling a very simple neural network.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Learn how to create your own modules in PyTorch, by inheriting from `nn.Module`
> - Assemble the pieces together to create a simple fully-connected network, to classify MNIST digits

### 2️⃣ Training Neural Networks

Here, you'll learn how to write a training loop in PyTorch. We'll keep it simple for today (and later on we'll experiment with more modular and extensible designs).

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Understand how to work with transforms, datasets and dataloaders
> - Understand the basic structure of a training loop
> - Learn how to write your own validation loop

### 3️⃣ Convolutions

In this section, you'll read about convolutions, and implement them as an `nn.Module` (not from scratch; we leave that to the bonus exercises). You'll also learn about maxpooling, and implement that as well.

## Subclassing `nn.Module`

One of the most basic parts of PyTorch that you will see over and over is the `nn.Module` class. All types of neural net components inherit from it, from the simplest `nn.Relu` to the most complex `nn.Transformer`. Often, a complex `nn.Module` will have sub-`Module`s which implement smaller pieces of its functionality.

Other common `Module`s  you'll see include

- `nn.Linear`, for fully-connected layers with or without a bias
- `nn.Conv2d`, for a two-dimensional convolution (we'll see more of these in a future section)
- `nn.Softmax`, which implements the [softmax](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html) function

The list goes on, including activation functions, normalizations, pooling, attention, and more. You can see all the `Module`s that PyTorch provides [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html). You can also create your own `Module`s, as we will do often!

The `Module` class provides a lot of functionality, but we'll only cover a little bit of it here.

In this section, we'll add another layer of abstraction to all the linear operations we've done in previous sections, by packaging them inside `nn.Module` objects.
'''

### `__init__` and `forward`

A subclass of `nn.Module` usually looks something like this:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2, ...):
        super().__init__()
        # Initialization code

    def forward(self, x: t.Tensor) -> t.Tensor:
        # Forward pass code
```

The initialization sets up attributes that will be used for the life of the `Module`, like its parameters, hyperparameters, or other sub-`Module`s it might need to use. These are usually added to the instance with something like `self.attribute = attr`, where `attr` might be provided as an argument. Some modules are simple enough that they don't need any persistent attributes, and in this case you can skip the `__init__`.

The `forward` method is called on each forward pass of the `Module`, possibly using the attributes that were set up in the `__init__`. It should take in the input, do whatever it's supposed to do, and return the result. Subclassing `nn.Module` automatically makes instances of your class callable, so you can do `model(x)` on an input `x` to invoke the `forward` method.

### The `nn.Parameter` class

A `nn.Parameter` is a special type of `Tensor`. Basically, this is the class that torch has provided for storing the weights and biases of a `Module`. It has some special properties for doing this:

- If a `Parameter` is set as an attribute of a `Module`, it will be auto-detected by torch and returned when you call `module.parameters()` (along with all the other `Parameters` associated with the `Module`, or any of the `Module`'s sub-modules!).
- This makes it easy to pass all the parameters of a model into an optimizer and update them all at once.

When you create a `Module` that has weights or biases, be sure to wrap them in `nn.Parameter` so that torch can detect and update them appropriately:

```python
class MyModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, weights: t.Tensor, biases: t.Tensor):
        super().__init__()
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(weights) # wrapping a tensor in nn.Parameter
        self.biases = nn.Parameter(biases)
```
'''

r'''
### Printing information with `extra_repr`

Another useful method is called `extra_repr`. This allows you to format the string representation of your `Module` in a way that's more informative than the default. For example, the following:

```python
class MyModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2, ...):
        super().__init__()
        # Initialization code

    def extra_repr(self) -> str:
        return f"arg1={self.arg1}, arg2={self.arg2}, ..."
```

will result in the output `"MyModule(arg1=arg1, arg2=arg2, ...)"` when you print an instance of this module. You might want to take this opportunity to print out useful invariant information about the module. The Python built-in function `getattr` might be helpful here (it can be used e.g. as `getattr(self, "arg1")`, which returns the same as `self.arg1` would). For simple modules, it's fine not to implement `extra_repr`.

## ReLU

The first module you should implement is `ReLU`. This will relatively simple, since it doesn't involve any argument (so we only need to implement `forward`). Make sure you look at the PyTorch documentation page for [ReLU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html) so that you're comfortable with what they do and why they're useful in neural networks.

## Linear

Now implement your own `Linear` module. This applies a simple linear transformation, with a weight matrix and optional bias vector. The PyTorch documentation page is [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html). Note that this is the first `Module` you'll implement that has learnable weights and biases.

<details>
<summary>Question - what type should these variables be?</summary>

They have to be `torch.Tensor` objects wrapped in `nn.Parameter` in order for `nn.Module` to recognize them. If you forget to do this, `module.parameters()` won't include your `Parameter`, which prevents an optimizer from being able to modify it during training.
        
Also, in tomorrow's exercises we'll be building a ResNet and loading in weights from a pretrained model, and this is hard to do if you haven't registered all your parameters!
</details>

For any layer, initialization is very important for the stability of training: with a bad initialization, your model will take much longer to converge or may completely fail to learn anything. The default PyTorch behavior isn't necessarily optimal and you can often improve performance by using something more custom, but we'll follow it for today because it's simple and works decently well.

Each float in the weight and bias tensors are drawn independently from the uniform distribution on the interval:

$$
\bigg[-\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{in}}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{in}}}\bigg]
$$

where $N_{in}$ is the number of inputs contributing to each output value. The rough intuition for this is that it keeps the variance of the activations at each layer constant, since each one is calculated by taking the sum over $N_{in}$ inputs multiplied by the weights (and standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables scales as the square root of number of variables).

This initialization technique is called **uniform Kaiming initialization**. A few last notes on initialization methods:

- Kaiming often has a different constant in the numerator depending on what the target variance is, also there are uniform & normal variants of it (we'll only be using the uniform variant)
- **Xavier initialization** is the other well-known technique, and differs in that it uses $N_{in} + N_{out}$ in the denominator (this makes sense when also considering variance scaling of backward passes as well as forward passes - see the next dropdown for technical details)

<details>
<summary>Technical details (derivation of distribution)</summary>

The key intuition behind Kaiming initialisation (and others like it) is that we want the variance of our activations to be the same through all layers of the model when we initialize. Suppose $x$ and $y$ are activations from two adjacent layers, and $w$ are the weights connecting them (so we have $y_i = \sum_j w_{ij} x_j + b_i$, where $b$ is the bias). With $N_{x}$ as the number of neurons in layer $x$, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{Var}\left(y_i\right)=\sigma_x^2 & =\operatorname{Var}\left(\sum_j w_{i j} x_j\right) \\
& =\sum_j \operatorname{Var}\left(w_{i j} x_j\right) \quad \text { Inputs and weights are independent of each other } \\
& =\sum_j \operatorname{Var}\left(w_{i j}\right) \cdot \operatorname{Var}\left(x_j\right) \quad \text { Variance of product of independent RVs with zero mean is product of variances } \\
& = N_x \cdot \sigma_x^2 \cdot \operatorname{Var}\left(w_{i j}\right) \quad \text { Variance equal for all } N_x \text { neurons, call this value } \sigma_x^2
\end{aligned}
$$

For this to be the same as $\sigma_x^2$, we need $\operatorname{Var}(w_{ij}) = \frac{1}{N_x}$, so the standard deviation is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_x}}$.

This is not exactly the case for the Kaiming uniform distribution (which has variance $\frac{12}{(2 \sqrt{N_x})^2} = \frac{3}{N_x}$), and as far as I'm aware there's no principled reason why PyTorch does this. But the most important thing is that the variance scales as $O(1 / N_x)$, rather than what the exact scaling constant is.

There are other initializations with some theoretical justification. For instance, **Xavier initialization** has a uniform distribution in the interval:

$$
\bigg[-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{N_{in} + N_{out} + 1}}, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{N_{in} + N_{out} + 1}}\bigg]
$$

which is motivated by the idea of both keeping the variance of activations constant and keeping the ***gradients*** constant when we backpropagate.

However, you don't need to worry about any of this here, just implement Kaiming He uniform with a bound of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{in}}}$!

This is because you've (correctly) defined `self.bias` as either `torch.Tensor` or `None`, rather than set it to the boolean value of `bias` used in initialisation.
        
To fix this, you will need to change `extra_repr` so that it prints the boolean value of `bias` rather than the value of `self.bias`.

## Flatten

Lastly, we've given you the `Flatten` module. This is a standardised way to rearrange our tensors so that they can be fed into a linear layer. It's a bit like `einops.flatten`, but more specialised and less flexible (it flattens over some contiguous range of dimensions, rather than allowing for general reshape operations). By default we use `Flatten(start_dim=1, end_dim=-1)` which means flattening over the dimensions from `input.shape[1:-1]`, in other words over all except the batch dimension.

Make sure you understand what this module is doing before moving on.

<!-- <details>
<summary>Help - I can't figure out what shape the output should be in Flatten.</summary>

If `input.shape = (n0, n1, ..., nk)`, and the `Flatten` module has `start_dim=i, end_dim=j`, then the new shape should be `(n0, n1, ..., ni*...*nj, ..., nk)`. This is because we're **flattening** over the dimensions `(ni, ..., nj)`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Help - I can't see why my Flatten module is failing the tests.</summary>

The most common reason is failing to correctly handle indices. Make sure that:
* You're indexing up to **and including** `end_dim`.
* You're correctly managing the times when `end_dim` is negative (e.g. if `input` is an nD tensor, and `end_dim=-1`, this should be interpreted as `end_dim=n-1`).

## Simple Multi-Layer Perceptron

Now, we can put together these two modules to create a neural network. We'll create one of the simplest networks which can be used to separate data that is non-linearly separable: a single linear layer, followed by a nonlinear function (ReLU), followed by another linear layer. This type of architecture (alternating linear layers and nonlinear functions) is often called a **multi-layer perceptron** (MLP).

The output of this network will have 10 dimensions, corresponding to the 10 classes of MNIST digits. We can then use the **softmax function** $x_i \to \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_i e^{x_i}}$ to turn these values into probabilities. However, it's common practice for the output of a neural network to be the values before we take softmax, rather than after. We call these pre-softmax values the **logits**.

<details>
<summary>Question - can you see what makes logits non-unique (i.e. why any given set of probabilities might correspond to several different possible sets of logits)?</summary>

Logits are **translation invariant**. If you add some constant $c$ to all logits $x_i$, then the new probabilities are:

$$
p_i' = \frac{e^{x_i + c}}{\sum_j e^{x_j + c}} = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}} = p_i
$$

in other words, the probabilities don't change.

We can define **logprobs** as the log of the probabilities, i.e. $y_i = \log p_i$. Unlike logits, these are uniquely defined.

## Transforms, Datasets & DataLoaders

Before we use this model to make any predictions, we first need to think about our input data. Below is a block of code to fetch and process MNIST data. We will go through it line by line.
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: code
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

MNIST_TRANSFORM = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))])


def get_mnist(subset: int = 1):
    """Returns MNIST training data, sampled by the frequency given in `subset`."""
    mnist_trainset = datasets.MNIST(root="./data", train=True, download=True, transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM)
    mnist_testset = datasets.MNIST(root="./data", train=False, download=True, transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM)

    if subset > 1:
        mnist_trainset = Subset(mnist_trainset, indices=range(0, len(mnist_trainset), subset))
        mnist_testset = Subset(mnist_testset, indices=range(0, len(mnist_testset), subset))

    return mnist_trainset, mnist_testset


if MAIN:
    mnist_trainset, mnist_testset = get_mnist()
    mnist_trainloader = DataLoader(mnist_trainset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
    mnist_testloader = DataLoader(mnist_testset, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)

The `torchvision` package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision. `transforms` is a library from `torchvision` which provides access to a suite of functions for preprocessing data.

We define a transform for the MNIST data (which is applied to each image in the dataset) by composing `ToTensor` (which converts a `PIL.Image` object into a PyTorch tensor) and `Normalize` (which takes arguments for the mean and standard deviation, and performs the linear transformation `x -> (x - mean) / std`).
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
Next, we define our datasets, using the `torchvision.datasets` library. The argument `root="./data"` indicates that we're storing our data in the `./data` directory, and `transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM` tells us that we should apply our previously defined `transform` to each element in our dataset.

The `Subset` function allows us to take a subset of a dataset. The argument `indices` is a list of indices to sample from the dataset. For example, `Subset(mnist_trainset, indices=[0, 1, 2])` will return a dataset containing only the first three elements of `mnist_trainset`.

Finally, `DataLoader` provides a useful abstraction to work with a dataset. It takes in a dataset, and a few arguments including `batch_size` (how many inputs to feed through the model on which to compute the loss before each step of gradient descent) and `shuffle` (whether to randomise the order each time you iterate). The object that it returns can be iterated through as follows:

```python
for X, y in mnist_trainloader:
    ...
```

where `X` is a 3D array of shape `(batch_size, 28, 28)` where each slice is an image, and `y` is a 1D tensor of labels of length `batch_size`. Without using this helpful object, we'd have to iterate through our dataset as follows:

```python
for i in range(len(mnist_trainset) // batch_size):
    
    X = mnist_trainset.data[i*batch_size: (i+1)*batch_size]
    y = mnist_trainset.targets[i*batch_size: (i+1)*batch_size]

    ...
```

A note about batch size - it's common to see batch sizes which are powers of two. The motivation is for efficient GPU utilisation, since processor architectures are normally organised around powers of 2, and computational efficiency is often increased by having the items in each batch split across processors. Or at least, that's the idea. The truth is a bit more complicated, and some studies dispute whether it actually saves time. We'll dive much deeper into these kinds of topics during the week on training at scale.

Before proceeding, try and answer the following questions:


<details>
<summary>Question - can you explain why we include a data normalization function in <code>torchvision.transforms</code> ?</summary>

One consequence of unnormalized data is that you might find yourself stuck in a very flat region of the domain, and gradient descent may take much longer to converge.

Normalization isn't strictly necessary for this reason, because any rescaling of an input vector can be effectively undone by the network learning different weights and biases. But in practice, it does usually help speed up convergence.

Normalization also helps avoid numerical issues.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Question - what is the benefit of using <code>shuffle=True</code> when defining our dataloaders? What might the problem be if we didn't do this?</summary>

Shuffling is done during the training to make sure we aren't exposing our model to the same cycle (order) of data in every epoch. It is basically done to ensure the model isn't adapting its learning to any kind of spurious pattern.

### Aside - `tqdm`

You might have seen some blue progress bars running when you first downloaded your MNIST data. These were generated using a library called `tqdm`, which is also a really useful tool when training models or running any process that takes a long period of time.

You can run the cell below to see how these progress bars are used (note that you might need to install the `tqdm` library first).


```python
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
import time

for i in tqdm(range(100)):
    time.sleep(0.01)
```

`tqdm` wraps around a list, range or other iterable, but other than that it doesn't affect the structure of your loop.

One gotcha when it comes to `tqdm` - you need to make sure you pass it something with a well-defined length. For instance, if you pass it an `enumerate` or `zip` object, it won't work as expected because it can't infer length from the object. You can fix this problem by wrapping your iterator in a list (e.g. `tqdm(list(zip(...)))`).

### Aside - `device`

One last thing to discuss before we move onto training our model: **GPUs**. We'll discuss this in more detail in later exercises. For now, [this page](https://wandb.ai/wandb/common-ml-errors/reports/How-To-Use-GPU-with-PyTorch---VmlldzozMzAxMDk) should provide a basic overview of how to use your GPU. A few things to be aware of here:

* The `to` method is really useful here - it can move objects between different devices (i.e. CPU and GPU) *as well as* changing a tensor's datatype.
    * Note that `to` is never inplace for tensors (i.e. you have to call `x = x.to(device)`), but when working with models, calling `model = model.to(device)` or `model.to(device)` are both perfectly valid.
* Errors from having one tensor on cpu and another on cuda are very common. Some useful practices to avoid this:
    * Throw in assert statements, to make sure tensors are on the same device
    * Remember that when you initialise an array (e.g. with `t.zeros` or `t.arange`), it will be on CPU by default.
    * Tensor methods like [`new_zeros`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_zeros.html) or [`new_full`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.new_full.html) are useful, because they'll create tensors which match the device and dtype of the base tensor.

It's common practice to put a line like this at the top of your file, defining a global variable which you can use in subsequent modules and functions (excluding the print statement):
'''

## Training loop

Below is a very simple training loop, which you can run to train your model.

In later exercises, we'll try to **modularize** our training loops. This will involve things like creating a `Trainer` class which wraps around our model, and giving it methods like `training_step` and `validation_step` which correspond to different parts of the training loop. This will make it easier to add features like logging and validation, and will also make our code more readable and easier to refactor. However, for now we've kept things simple.

Let's break down the important parts of this code.

The batch size is the number of samples in each batch (i.e. the number of samples we feed into the model at once). While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.

Next, we get our training set, via the helper function `get_mnist`. This helper function used `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to load in data, and then (optionally) the `torch.utils.data.Subset` function to return a subset of this data. Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.

We then define our optimizer, using `torch.optim.Adam`. The `torch.optim` module gives a wide variety of modules, such as Adam, SGD, and RMSProp. Adam is generally the most popular and seen as the most effective in the majority of cases. We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).

Lastly, we have the actual training loop. We iterate through our training data, and for each batch we:

1. Evaluate our model on the batch of data, to get the logits for our class predictions,
2. Calculate the loss between our logits and the true class labels,
3. Backpropagate the loss through our model (this step accumulates gradients in our model parameters),
4. Step our optimizer, which is what actually updates the model parameters,
5. Zero the gradients of our optimizer, ready for the next step.

### Cross entropy loss

The formula for cross entropy loss over a batch of size $N$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
l &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} l_n \\
l_n &=-\log p_{n, y_{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $p_{n, c}$ is the probability the model assigns to class $c$ for sample $n$, and $y_{n}$ is the true label for this sample.

<details>
<summary>See this dropdown, if you're still confused about this formula, and how this relates to the information-theoretic general formula for cross entropy.</summary>

The cross entropy of a distribution $p$ relate to a distribution $q$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
H(q, p) &= -\sum_{n} q(n) \log p(n)
\end{aligned}
$$

In our case, $q$ is the true distribution (i.e. the one-hot encoded labels, which equals one for $n = y_n$, zero otherwise), and $p$ is our model's output. With these subsitutions, this formula becomes equivalent to the formula for $l$ given above.
</details>

<details>
<summary>See this dropdown, if you're confused about how this is the same as the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html#torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss">PyTorch definition</a>.</summary>

The PyTorch definition of cross entropy loss is:

$$
\ell(x, y)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} l_n, \quad l_n=-\sum_{c=1}^C w_c \log \frac{\exp \left(x_{n, c}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^C \exp \left(x_{n, i}\right)} y_{n, c}
$$

$w_c$ are the weights (which all equal one by default), $p_{n, c} = \frac{\exp \left(x_{n, c}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^C \exp \left(x_{n, i}\right)}$ are the probabilities, and $y_{n, c}$ are the true labels (which are one-hot encoded, i.e. their value is one at the correct label $c$ and zero everywhere else). With this, the formula for $l_n$ reduces to the one we see above (i.e. the mean of the negative log probabilities).

</details>

The function `torch.functional.cross_entropy` expects the **unnormalized logits** as its first input, rather than probabilities. We get probabilities from logits by applying the softmax function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_{n, c} &= \frac{\exp(x_{n, c})}{\sum_{c'=1}^{C} \exp(x_{n, c'})}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $x_{n, c}$ is the model's output for class $c$ and sample $n$, and $C$ is the number of classes (in the case of MNIST, $C = 10$).

Some terminology notes:

* When we say **logits**, we mean the output of the model before applying softmax. We can uniquely define a distribution with a set of logits, just like we can define a distribution with a set of probabilities (and sometimes it's easier to think of a distribution in terms of logits, as we'll see later in the course).

* When we say **unnormalized**, we mean the denominator term $\sum_{c'} \exp(x_{n, c'})$ isn't necessarily equal to 1. We can add a constant value onto all the logits which makes this term 1 without changing any of the actual probabilities, then we have the relation $p_{n, c} = \exp(-l_{n, c})$. Here, we call $-l_{n, c}$ the **log probabilities** (or log probs), since $-l_{n, c} = \log p_{n, c}$.

If you're interested in the intuition behind cross entropy as a loss function, see [this post on KL divergence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/no5jDTut5Byjqb4j5/six-and-a-half-intuitions-for-kl-divergence) (note that KL divergence and cross entropy differ by an amount which is independent of our model's predictions, so minimizing cross entropy is equivalent to minimizing KL divergence). Also see these two videos:

### Aside - `dataclasses`

Sometimes, when we have a lot of different input parameters to our model, it can be helpful to use dataclasses to keep track of them all. Dataclasses are a special kind of class which come with built-in methods for initialising and printing (i.e. no need to define an `__init__` or `__repr__`). Another advantage of using them is autocompletion: when you type in `args.` in VSCode, you'll get a dropdown of all your different dataclass attributes, which can be useful when you've forgotten what you called a variable!

Here's an example of how we might rewrite our training code above using dataclasses. We've wrapped all the training code inside a single argument called `train`, which takes a `SimpleMLPTrainingArgs` object as its only argument.

### Exercise - add a validation loop

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
> 
> You should spend up to ~20 minutes on this exercise.
> 
> It is very important that you understand training loops and how they work, because we'll be doing a lot of model training in this way.
> ```

Edit the `train` function above to include a validation loop. Train your model, making sure you measure the accuracy at the end of each epoch.

Here are a few tips to help you:

* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.
    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.
* You don't need to convert to probabilities before calculating accuracy (or even to logprobs), because softmax is an order-preserving function.
* You can wrap your code in `with t.inference_mode():` to make sure that your model is in inference mode during validation (i.e. gradients don't propagate).
    * Note you could also use the decorator `@t.inference_mode()` to do this, if your training loop was a function.
* The `get_mnist` function returns both a trainset and a testset. In the `train` function above we only used the first one, but you should use both.
* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation.

## Convolutions

Here are some questions about convolutions to make sure you've understood the material. Once you finish the article above, you should try and answer these questions without referring back to the original article.

<details>
<summary>Why would convolutional layers be less likely to overfit data than standard linear (fully connected) layers?</summary>

Convolutional layers require significantly fewer weights to be learned. This is because the same kernel is applied all across the image, rather than every pair of `(input, output)` nodes requiring a different weight to be learned.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Suppose you fixed some random permutation of the pixels in an image, and applied this to all images in your dataset, before training a convolutional neural network for classifying images. Do you expect this to be less effective, or equally effective?</summary>

It will be less effective, because CNNs work thanks to **spatial locality** - groups of pixels close together are more meaningful. For instance, CNNs will often learn convolutions at an early layer which recognise gradients or simple shapes. If you permute the pixels (even if you permute in the same way for every image), you destroy locality.
</details>

<details>
<summary>If you have a 28x28 image, and you apply a 3x3 convolution with stride 1, padding 1, what shape will the output be?</summary>

It will be the same shape, i.e. `28x28`. In the post linked above, this is described as **same padding**. Tomorrow, we'll build an MNIST classifier which uses these convolutions.

A note on terminology - you might see docs and docstrings sometimes use `num_features`, sometimes use `channels`, and sometimes just `C`. Often these two terms interchangeable. Our neural network inputs will often be RGB images and so we will have `channels=3` corresponding to the 3 colors red/green/blue. As we pass our initial image through convolutional layers, the number of channels will change. In the context of convolutions, the number of features and number of channels usually refer to the same value.

### Exercise - implement `Conv2d`

> ```yaml

> Make sure you understand what operation is taking place here, and how the dimensions are changing.
> ```

Rather than implementing the `conv2d` function from scratch, we'll allow you to use `t.nn.functional.conv2d`. In the exercise below, you should use this function to implement the `nn.Conv2d` layer. In other words, you should:

* Initialize the weights for the convolutional layer in the `__init__` function.
    * You should look at the PyTorch page for `nn.Conv2d` [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) to understand what the shape of the weights should be.
    * We assume `bias=False`, so the only `nn.Parameter` object we need to define is `weight`.
    * You should use **uniform Kaiming initialization** like you have before, i.e. the bounds of the uniform distribution should be $1/N_{in}$ where $N_{in}$ is the product of input channels and kernel height & width, as described at the bottom of the `nn.Conv2d` docs (the bullet points under the **Variables** header).
* Implement the `forward` method, which should apply the convolutional layer to the input.
    * In other words, it should implement the `torch.nn.functional.conv2d` function (documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.conv2d.html)), using the weights and biases (and other layer parameters) that you initialized in `__init__`.
* Fill in the `extra_repr` method, to print out the convolutional layer's parameters.

<details>
<summary>Question - why do you think we use the product of input channels and kernel height & width for our Kaiming initialization bounds?</summary>

This is because each value in the output is computed by taking the product over `in_channels * kernel_height * kernel_width` elements, analogously to how each value in the linear layer is computed by taking the product over just `in_features` elements.

### `MaxPool2d`

We've given you `MaxPool2d` below. This is a wrapper for the `max_pool2d` function (although in the bonus exercises later you can implement your own version of this).

The maxpool module is often applied after a convolutional layer, to reduce the spatial dimensions of the output. It works by taking the maximum value in each kernel-sized window, and outputting that value. For instance, if we have a 2x2 kernel, then we take the maximum of each 2x2 window in the input.

* [Batch Normalization in Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/batch-normalization-cnn)
* [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)

You should move on once you can answer the following questions:


<details>
<summary>"Batch Normalization allows us to be less careful about initialization." Explain this statement.</summary>

Weight initialisation methods like Xavier (which we encountered yesterday) are based on the idea of making sure the activations have approximately the same distribution across layers at initialisation. But batch normalisation ensures that this is the case as signals pass through the network.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Give three reasons why batch norm improves the performance of neural networks.</summary>

The reasons given in the first linked document above are:

* Normalising inputs speeds up computation
* Internal covariate shift is reduced, i.e. the mean and standard deviation is kept constant across the layers.
* Regularisation effect: noise internal to each minibatch is reduced
</details>

<details>
<summary>If you have an input tensor of size (batch, channels, width, height), and you apply a batchnorm layer, how many learned parameters will there be?</summary>

A mean and standard deviation is calculated for each channel (i.e. each calculation is done across the batch, width, and height dimensions). So the number of learned params will be `2 * channels`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>In the paper, the diagram shows additive skip connections (i.e. F(x) + x). One can also form concatenated skip connections, by "gluing together" F(x) and x into a single tensor. Give one advantage and one disadvantage of these, relative to additive connections.</summary>

One advantage of concatenation: the subsequent layers can re-use middle representations; maintaining more information which can lead to better performance. Also, this still works if the tensors aren't exactly the same shape. One disadvantage: less compact, so there may be more weights to learn in subsequent layers.

Crucially, both the addition and concatenation methods have the property of preserving information, to at least some degree of fidelity. For instance, you can [use calculus to show](https://theaisummer.com/skip-connections/#:~:text=residual%20skip%20connections.-,ResNet%3A%20skip%20connections%C2%A0via%C2%A0addition,-The%20core%20idea) that both methods will fix the vanishing gradients problem.
</details>


In this section, we'll do a more advanced version of the exercise in part 1. Rather than building a relatively simple network in which computation can be easily represented by a sequence of simple layers, we're going to build a more complex architecture which requires us to define nested blocks.

We'll start by defining a few more `nn.Module` objects, which we hadn't needed before.
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown

r'''
## Sequential

Firstly, now that we're working with large and complex architectures, we should create a version of `nn.Sequential`. As the name suggests, when an `nn.Sequential` is fed an input, it sequentially applies each of its submodules to the input, with the output from one module feeding into the next one.

The implementation is given to you below. A few notes:

* In initalization, we add to the `_modules` dictionary.
    * This is a special type of dict called an **ordered dictionary**, which preserves the order of elements that get added (although Python sort-of does this now by default).
    * When we call `self.parameters()`, this recursively goes through all modules in `self._modules`, and returns the params in those modules. This means we can nest sequentials within sequentials!
* The special `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` methods determine behaviour when we get and set modules within the sequential.
* The `repr` of the base class `nn.Module` already recursively prints out the submodules, so we don't need to write anything in `extra_repr`.
    * To see how this works in practice, try defining a `Sequential` which takes a sequence of modules that you've defined above, and see what it looks like when you print it.

Don't worry about deeply understanding this code. The main takeaway is that `nn.Sequential` is a useful list-like object to store modules, and apply them all sequentially.

<details>
<summary>Aside - initializing Sequential with an OrderedDict</summary>

The actual `nn.Sequential` module can be initialized with an ordered dictionary, rather than a list of modules. For instance, rather than doing this:

```python
seq = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 20),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(20, 30)
)
```

we can do this:

```python
seq = nn.Sequential(OrderedDict([
    ("linear1", nn.Linear(10, 20)),
    ("relu", nn.ReLU()),
    ("linear2", nn.Linear(20, 30))
]))
```

This is handy if we want to give each module an descriptive name.

The `Sequential` implementation below doesn't allow the input to be an OrderedDict. As a bonus exercise, can you rewrite the `__init__`, `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` methods to allow the input to be an OrderedDict?

## BatchNorm2d

Now, we'll implement our `BatchNorm2d`, the layer described in the reading material you hopefully read above. You'll be implementing it according to the [PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html) (with `affine=True` and `track_running_stats=True`).

### Buffers

A question that might have occurred to you as you read about batch norm - how does averaging over datapoints work in inference mode, when you might just be passing in a single datapoint? To explain this, we have to introduce a new PyTorch concept: **buffers**.

A buffer is somewhere between a `nn.Parameter` and a regular tensor. It's like a parameter in that it's included in `model.state_dict()`, saved & loaded during methods like `torch.save` and `torch.load`, etc. However it's not included in `model.parameters()`, meaning we don't optimize over it during training. It's generally used for things like tracking moving averages during training (i.e. updates are made to it manually within the `forward` method), and that's how we'll be using it here.

You can create a buffer by calling [`self.register_buffer`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module.register_buffer) from inside a `nn.Module`. We've initialized the necessary buffers for you in the `__init__` method below - you'll need a running mean and variance, as well as a counter for the number of batches seen (technically this isn't strictly necessary because the running mean & variance are updated using an exponential moving average so the update rule is independent of the number of previous updates, but we're doing this so our state dict matches the PyTorch implementation).
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
### Train and Eval Modes

Okay so we have buffers, but how can we make them behave differently in different modes - i.e. updating the running mean & variance in training mode, and using the stored values in eval mode? The answer is that we use the `training` method of the `nn.Module` class, which is a boolean attribute that gets flipped when we call `self.eval()` or `self.train()`. In the case of batch norm, your code should look like this:

```python
if self.training:
    # Compute new `mean` and `var` of data, and update the running values `self.running_mean` and `self.running_var`
    ...
else:
    # Set `mean` and `var` to be the stored values `self.running_mean` and `self.running_var`
    ...

# Normalize `x` using the computed values `mean` and `var`
```

The other commonly used module which has different behaviour in training and eval modes is `Dropout` - in eval mode this module uses all its inputs, but in training it randomly selects some fraction `1 - p` of the input values to zero out and scales the remaining values by `1 / (1 - p)`. 

Note that other normalization modules we'll address later in this course like `LayerNorm` don't have different behaviour in training and eval modes, because these don't normalize over the batch dimension. It's only this batch dim normalization that requires us to have different behaviour in training and eval modes.

### Exercise - implement `BatchNorm2d`

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 15-30 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Implement `BatchNorm2d` according to the [PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html). We're implementing it with `affine=True` and `track_running_stats=True`. All the parameters are defined for you in the `__init__` method, your job will be to fill in the `forward` and `extra_repr` methods.

A few final tips:

- Remember to differentiate between training mode, when `self.training=True` (you calculate mean & variance and update the running values) and eval mode, when `self.training=False` (you use the running values).
- After you've normalized `x`, don't forget to multiply by `weight` and add `bias` (you might need to reshape these tensors so that they broadcast correctly).
- When computing mean and variance, you're reducing over all dimensions except the channel dimension - this is why your `mean` and `var` tensors should have shape `(num_features,)`, as well as your buffers `running_mean` and `running_var`.
    - When using your computed mean and variance to normalize `x`, remember to broadcast them to a shape like `(1, num_features, 1, 1)` first, otherwise your operations won't work.

## AveragePool

Let's end our collection of `nn.Module`s with an easy one 🙂

The ResNet has a Linear layer with 1000 outputs at the end in order to produce classification logits for each of the 1000 classes. Any Linear needs to have a constant number of input features, but the ResNet is supposed to be compatible with arbitrary height and width, so we can't just do a pooling operation with a fixed kernel size and stride.

Luckily, the simplest possible solution works decently: take the mean over the spatial dimensions. Intuitively, each position has an equal "vote" for what objects it can "see".

This should be a pretty straightforward implementation; it doesn't have any weights or parameters of any kind, so you only need to implement the `forward` method.

## Building ResNet

Now we have all the building blocks we need to start assembling your own ResNet! The following diagram describes the architecture of ResNet34 - the other versions are broadly similar. Unless otherwise noted, convolutions have a kernel_size of 3x3, a stride of 1, and a padding of 1. None of the convolutions have biases.

You don't have to understand every detail in this diagram before proceeding; specific points will be clarified as we go through each exercise.

<details>
<summary>Question: why do we not care about including biases in the convolutional layers?</summary>

Every convolution layer in this network is followed by a batch normalization layer. The first operation in the batch normalization layer is to subtract the mean of each output channel. But a convolutional bias just adds some scalar `b` to each output channel, increasing the mean by `b`. This means that for any `b` added, the batch normalization will subtract `b` to exactly negate the bias term.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm confused about how the nested subgraphs work.</summary>

The right-most block in the diagram, `ResidualBlock`, is nested inside `BlockGroup` multiple times. When you see `ResidualBlock` in `BlockGroup`, you should visualise a copy of `ResidualBlock` sitting in that position.
    
Similarly, `BlockGroup` is nested multiple times (four to be precise) in the full `ResNet34` architecture.

### Exercise - implement `ResidualBlock`

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 15-30 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Implement `ResidualBlock` by referring to the diagram.  A few more notes on the left and right branches of this diagram:

- The **left branch** starts with a strided convolution which changes the number of features from `in_feats` to `out_feats`. The second convolution is shape-preserving (i.e. it maps from `out_feats` to `out_feats`, and it has stride 1, padding 1, kernel size 3, which results in the same `width` and `height` dimensions as the input).
- The **right branch** is effectively a skip connection. If we use stride 1 in the left branch and `in_feats == out_feats` then that branch is shape-preserving, so we can set the right branch to be the identity (that's what the "OPTIONAL" annotation refers to). But if one of these conditions is not met then we replace this right branch with a 1x1 convolution and batchnorm, where the convolution has the same stride and input/output channel arguments as the left branch's first convolution. This is effectively as close to a skip connection as we can get while still making sure the right branch output shape matches the left branch - we're effectively just downsampling and normalizing our input.

### Exercise - implement `BlockGroup`

> ```yaml

> 
> You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Implement `BlockGroup` according to the diagram. There should be `n_blocks` total blocks in the group. Only the first block has the possibility of having a right branch (because we might have either `first_stride > 1` or `in_feats != out_feats`), but every subsequent block will have the identity instead of a right branch.

<details>
<summary>Help - I don't understand why all blocks after the first one won't have a right branch.</summary>

- The `first_stride` argument only gets applied to the first block, definitionally (i.e. the purpose of the `BlockGroup` is to downsample the input by `first_stride` just once, not on every single block).
- After we pass through the first block we can guarantee that the number of channels will be `out_feats`, so every subsequent block will have `out_feats` input channels and `out_feats` output channels.

Combining these two facts, we see that every subsequent block will have a shape-preserving left branch, so it can have the identity as its right branch.

### Exercise - implement `ResNet34`

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 30-45 minutes on this exercise. This can sometimes involve a lot of fiddly debugging.
> ```

Last step! Assemble `ResNet34` using the diagram.

To test your implementation, you can use the helper function `print_param_count` which prints out a stylized dataframe comparing your model's parameter count to the PyTorch implementation. Alternatively, you can use the following code to import your own `resnet34`, and inspect its architecture:

```python
resnet = models.resnet34()
print(torchinfo.summary(resnet, input_size=(1, 3, 64, 64)))
print(torchinfo.summary(my_resnet, input_size=(1, 3, 64, 64)))
```

Both will give you the shape & size of each of your model's parameters & buffers, and code is provided for both of these methods below.

Note - in order to copy weights from the reference model to your implementation (which we'll do after this exercise), you'll need to have all the parameters defined in the same order as they are in the reference model - in other words, the rows from the two halves of the dataframe created via `print_param_count` should perfectly match up with each other. This can be a bit fiddly to get right, especially if the names of your parameters are different to the names in the PyTorch implementation. We recommend you look at the `__init__` methods of the solution if you're stuck (since it's the order that things are defined in for the various ResNet modules which determines the order of the rows in the dataframe).

This 1-to-1 weight comparison won't always be possible during model replications, for example when we replicate GPT2-Small next week we'll be defining the attention weight matrices differently (in a way that's more condusive to interpretability research). In these cases, you'll need to resort to different debugging methods, like running the models on the same input and checking they give the same output. You can also break this down into smaller steps by running individual models, and by checking the shape before checking values. However in this case we don't need to resort to that, because our implementation is equivalent to the reference model's implementation.

As a more general point, tweaking your model until all the layers match up might be a difficult and frustrating exercise at times, however it's a pretty good example of the kind of low-level model implementation and debugging that is important for your growth as ML engineers! So don't be disheartened if you find it hard to get exactly right (although we certainly recommend looking at the solutions and moving on if you're stuck on this particular exercise for more than ~45 minutes).

<summary>Help - I'm not sure how to construct each of the BlockGroups.</summary>

Each BlockGroup takes arguments `n_blocks`, `in_feats`, `out_feats` and `first_stride`. In the initialisation of `ResNet34` below, we're given a list of `n_blocks`, `out_feats` and `first_stride` for each of the BlockGroups. To find `in_feats` for each block, it suffices to note two things:
    
1. The first `in_feats` should be 64, because the input is coming from the convolutional layer with 64 output channels.
2. The `out_feats` of each layer should be equal to the `in_feats` of the subsequent layer (because the BlockGroups are stacked one after the other; with no operations in between to change the shape).

You can use these two facts to construct a list `in_features_per_group`, and then create your BlockGroups by zipping through all four lists.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm not sure how to construct the 7x7 conv at the very start.</summary>

The stride, padding & output channels are givin in the diagram; the only thing not provided is `in_channels`. Recall that the input to this layer is an RGB image - can you deduce from this how many input channels your layer should have?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm getting the right total parameter count, but my rows don't match up, and I'm not sure how to debug this.</summary>

We'll use an example case to illustrate how to debug this. In the following case, our rows match up until the 21st row where we have our first discrepancy:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/row-diff.png" width="1000">

We can see that the first discrepancy occurs at the first parameter from `residual_layers.1`, meaning something in the second `BlockGroup` in our sequential of blockgroups. We can see that the first blockgroup only had left branches but no right branches (this is because for the very first blockgroup we had `in_feats == out_feats == 64` and also `first_strides_per_group[0] == 1`, meaning this first blockgroup was shape-preserving and it didn't need a right branch). So it's the presence of a right branch that's causing the mismatch.

Looking closer at the dataframe, we see that the left-hand parameter (from our model) has shape `(128, 64, 1, 1)` and has `right` in its name, so we deduce it's the 1x1 convolutional weight from the right branch. But the parameter from the PyTorch model has shape `(128, 64, 3, 3)`, i.e. it's a convolutional weight with a 3x3 kernel, so must be from the left branch (it also matches the naming convention for the left-branch convolutional weight from the first blockgroup - row index 3 in the dataframe). So we've now figured out what the problem is: **your implementation defines the right branch before the left branch in the the `ResidualBlock.__init__` method, and to match param orders with the PyTorch model you should swap them around.**

Now that you've built your `ResNet34`, we'll copy weights over from PyTorch's pretrained resnet to yours. This is another good way to verify that you've designed the architecture correctly (although if you've passed all tests above and your parameter count order matches up, it's very likely that this code will also work).

### Exercise - verify your model's predictions

> ```yaml

> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to ~10 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Lastly, you should run your model with these prepared images, and verify that your predictions are the same as the model's predictions.

You can do this by filling in the `predict` function below, then running the code. We've also provided you with a file `imagenet_labels.json` which you can use to get the actual classnames of imagenet data, and see what your model's predictions actually are. 

When you run the code, you should find that your top prediction probabilities are within about 0.01% of the reference model's probabilities most (not all) of the time. This kind of error is not uncommon when you have slightly different orders of linear operations or small implementation details which differ between models, and which can introduce floating point errors that compound as we move through the model. As a bonus exercise (which may or may not break your sanity), you're welcome to try and work through our implementation, comparing it to the PyTorch model's implementation and find where the discrepancy comes from!

If you've done everything correctly, your version should give the same classifications, and the percentages should match at least to a couple decimal places.

If it does, congratulations, you've now run an entire ResNet, using barely any code from `torch.nn`! The only things we used were `nn.Module` and `nn.Parameter`.

If it doesn't, you get to practice model debugging! Remember to use the `utils.print_param_count` function that was provided.

### Aside - hooks

One problem you might have encountered is that your model outputs `NaN`s rather than actual numbers. When debugging this, it's useful to try and identify which module the error first appears in. This is a great use-case for **hooks**, which are something we'll be digging a lot more into during our mechanistic interpretability exercises later on.

A hook is basically a function which you can attach to a particular `nn.Module`, which gets executed during your model's forward or backward passes. Here, we'll only consider forward hooks. A hook function's type signature is:

```python
def hook(module: nn.Module, inputs: list[t.Tensor], output: t.Tensor) -> None:
    pass
```

The `inputs` argument is a list of the inputs to the module (often just one tensor), and the `output` argument is the output of the module. This hook gets registered to a module by calling `module.register_forward_hook(hook)`. During forward passes, the hook function will run.

Here is some code which will check for `NaN`s in the output of each module, and raise a `ValueError` if it finds any. We've also given you an example tiny network which produces a `NaN` in the output of the second layer, to demonstrate it on.

When you run this code, you should find it raising an error at the `NanModule`.


> Important - when you're working with PyTorch hooks, make sure you remember to remove them at the end of each exercise! This is a classic source of bugs, and one of the things that make PyTorch hooks so janky. When we study TransformerLens in the next chapter, we'll use a version of hooks that is essentially the same under the hood, but comes with quite a few quality of life improvements!

This section is designed to get you familiar with the implementational details of layers like `Linear` and `Conv2d`. You'll be using libraries like `einops`, and functions like `torch.as_strided` to get a very low-level picture of how these operations work, which will help build up your overall understanding.

Note that `torch.as_strided` isn't something which will come up explicitly in much of the rest of the course (unlike `einops`). The purpose of the stride exercises is more to give you an appreciation for what's going on under the hood, so that we can build layers of abstraction on top of that during the rest of this week (and by extension this course). I see this as analogous to how [many CS courses](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) start by teaching you about languages like C and concepts like pointers and memory management before moving on to higher-level langauges like Python which abstract away these details. The hope is that when you get to the later sections of the course, you'll have the tools to understand them better.

## Basic stride exercises

Array strides, and the `as_strided` method, are important to understand well because lots of linear operations are actually implementing something like `as_strided` under the hood.

Run the following code, to define this tensor:
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: code
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

test_input = t.tensor(
    [
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
        [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
        [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
        [15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
    ],
    dtype=t.float,
)


# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
This tensor is stored in a contiguous block in computer memory.

We can call the `stride` method to get the strides of this particular array. Running `test_input.stride()`, we get `(5, 1)`. This means that we need to skip over one element in the storage of this tensor to get to the next element in the row, and 5 elements to get the next element in the column (because you have to jump over all 5 elements in the row). Another way of phrasing this: the `n`th element in the stride is the number of elements we need to skip over to move one index position in the `n`th dimension.

### Exercise - fill in the correct size and stride

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to ~30 minutes on these exercises collectively.
> 
> as_strided exercises can be notoriously confusing and fiddly, so you should be willing to look at the solution if you're stuck. They are not the most important part of the material today.
> ```

In the exercises below, we will work with the `test_input` tensor above. You should fill in the `size` and `stride` arguments so that calling `test_input.as_strided` with these arguments produces the desired output. When you run the cell, the `for` loop at the end will iterate through the test cases and print out whether the test passed or failed.

We've already filled in the first two as an example, along with illustrations explaining what's going on:

so in this case, try to create an array with:

$$
\text{arr}[i, j, k] = \text{matA}[i, j] \times \text{matB}[j, k]

then sum this array over `j` to get our output.

We need to create expanded versions of both `matA` and `matB` in order to take this product.

We want to compute

$$

so our stride for `matA` should be `(matA.stride(0), matA.stride(1), 0)` (because we're repeating over the last dimension but iterating over the first 2 dimensions just like for the 2D matrix `matA`).

## conv1d minimal

Here, we will implement the PyTorch `conv1d` function, which can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html). We will start with a simple implementation where `stride=1` and `padding=0`, with the other arguments set to their default values.

Firstly, some explanation of `conv1d` in PyTorch. The `1` in `1d` here refers to the number of dimensions along which we slide the weights (also called the kernel) when we convolve. Importantly, it does not refer to the number of dimensions of the tensors that are being used in our calculations. Typically the input and kernel are both 3D:

* `input.shape = (batch, in_channels, width)`
* `kernel.shape = (out_channels, in_channels, kernel_width)`

A typical convolution operation is illustrated in the sketch below. Some notes on this sketch:

* The `kernel_width` dimension of the kernel slides along the `width` dimension of the input. The `output_width` of the output is determined by the number of kernels that can be fit inside it; the formula can be seen in the right part of the sketch.
* For each possible position of the kernel inside the model (i.e. each freezeframe position in the sketch), the operation happening is as follows:
    * We take the product of the kernel values with the corresponding input values, and then take the sum
    * This gives us a single value for each output channel
    * These values are then passed into the output tensor
* The sketch assumes a batch size of 1. To generalise to a larger batch number, we can just imagine this operation being repeated identically on every input.

### A note on `out_channels`

The out_channels in a conv2d layer denotes the number of filters the layer uses. Each filter detects specific features in the input, producing an output with as many channels as filters.

This number isn't tied to the input image's channels but is a design choice in the neural network architecture. Commonly, powers of 2 are chosen for computational efficiency, and deeper layers might have more channels to capture complex features. Additionally, this parameter is sometimes chosen based on the heuristic of wanting to balance the parameter count / compute for each layer - which is why you often see `out_channels` growing as the size of each feature map gets smaller.

Below, you should implement `conv1d_minimal`. This is a function which works just like `conv1d`, but takes the default stride and padding values (these will be added back in later). You are allowed to use `as_strided` and `einsum`.

Because this is a difficult exercise, we've given you a "simplified" function to implement first. This gets rid of the batch dimension, and input & output channel dimensions, so you only have to think about `x` and `weights` being one-dimensional tensors:

<summary>Help - I'm stuck on going from <code>conv1d_minimal_simple</code> to <code>conv1d_minimal</code>.</summary>

The principle is the same as before. In your function, you should:

* Create a strided version of `x` by adding a dimension of length `output_width` and with the same stride as the `width` stride of `x` (the purpose of which is to be able to do all the convolutions at once).
* Perform an einsum between this strided version of `x` and `weights`, summing over the appropriate dimensions.

The way each of the new dimensions `batch`, `out_channels` and `in_channels` are handled is as follows:

* `batch` - this is an extra dimension for `x`, it is *not* summed over when creating `output`.
* `out_channels` - this is an extra dimension for `weights`, it is *not* summed over when creating `output`.
* `in_channels` - this is an extra dimension for `weights` *and* for `x`, it *is* summed over when creating `output`.

## conv2d minimal

2D convolutions are conceptually similar to 1D. The only difference is in how you move the kernel across the tensor as you take your convolution. In this case, you will be moving the tensor across two dimensions:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/ch0-conv2d-v3.png" width=850>

You should be doing the same thing that you did for the 1D version. The only difference is that you're introducing 2 new dimensions to your strided version of x, rather than 1 (their sizes should be `output_height` and `output_width`, and their strides should be the same as the original `height` and `width` strides of `x` respectively).

For a full version of `conv`, and for `maxpool` (which will follow shortly), you'll need to implement `pad` helper functions. PyTorch has some very generic padding functions, but to keep things simple and build up gradually, we'll write 1D and 2D functions individually.

The `pad1d` function applies padding to the width dimension of a 1D tensor, i.e. we pad with `left` entries to the start of the last dimension of `x` and with `right` entries to the end of the last dimension of `x`.

Tips:
* Use the `new_full` method of the input tensor. This is a clean way to ensure that the output tensor is on the same device as the input, and has the same dtype.
* You can use three dots to denote slicing over multiple dimensions. For instance, `x[..., 0]` will take the `0th` slice of `x` along its last dimension. This is equivalent to `x[:, 0]` for 2D, `x[:, :, 0]` for 3D, etc.

## Full convolutions

Now, you'll extend `conv1d` to handle the `stride` and `padding` arguments.

`stride` is the number of input positions that the kernel slides at each step. `padding` is the number of zeros concatenated to each side of the input before the convolution.

Output shape should be `(batch, output_channels, output_length)`, where output_length can be calculated as follows:

$$
\text{output\_length} = \left\lfloor\frac{\text{input\_length} + 2 \times \text{padding} - \text{kernel\_size}}{\text{stride}} \right\rfloor + 1
$$

Verify for yourself that the forumla above simplifies to the formula we used earlier when padding is 0 and stride is 1.

Docs for pytorch's `conv1d` can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv1d.html).

## Max pooling

We have just one function left now - **max pooling**. You can review the [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-convolutional-neural-networks-the-eli5-way-3bd2b1164a53) post from earlier to understand max pooling better.

A "max pooling" layer is similar to a convolution in that you have a window sliding over some number of dimensions. The main difference is that there's no kernel: instead of multiplying by the kernel and adding, you just take the maximum.

The way multiple channels work is also different. A convolution has some number of input and output channels, and each output channel is a function of all the input channels. There can be any number of output channels. In a pooling layer, the maximum operation is applied independently for each input channel, meaning the number of output channels is necessarily equal to the number of input channels.

<summary>Hint</summary>

Conceptually, this is similar to `conv2d`.
    
In `conv2d`, you had to use `as_strided` to turn the 4D tensor `x` into a 6D tensor `x_strided` (adding dimensions over which you would take the convolution), then multiply this tensor by the kernel and sum over these two new dimensions.

`maxpool2d` is the same, except that you're simply taking max over those dimensions rather than a dot product with the kernel. So you should find yourself able to reuse a lot of code from your `conv2d` function.

<summary>Help - I'm getting a small number of mismatched elements each time (e.g. between 0 and 5%).</summary>

This is likely because you used an incorrect `pad_value`. In the convolution function, we set `pad_value=0` so these values wouldn't have any effect in the linear transformation. What pad value would make our padded elements "invisible" when we take the maximum?

r'''
Now that you've seen how to build a modular training loop, and you've seen how ResNet works and is built, we're going to put these two things together to finetune a ResNet model on a new dataset.

**Finetuning** can mean slightly different things in different contexts, but broadly speaking it means using the weights of an already trained network as the starting values for training a new network. Because training networks from scratch is very computationally expensive, this is a common practice in ML.

The specific type of finetuning we'll be doing here is called **feature extraction**. This is when we freeze most layers of a model except the last few, and perform gradient descent on those. We call this feature extraction because the earlier layers of the model have already learned to identify important features of the data (and these features are also relevant for the new task), so all that we have to do is train a few final layers in the model to extract these features.

*Terminology note - sometimes feature extraction and finetuning are defined differently, with finetuning referring to the training of all the weights in a pretrained model (usually with a small or decaying learning rate), and feature extraction referring to the freezing of some layers and training of others. To avoid confusion here, we'll use the term "feature extraction" rather than "finetuning".*

We'll discuss freezing layers & the backpropagation algorithm in much more detail tomorrow, but for now it's fine to just understand what's going on at a basic level. When we call `loss.backward()` in our training loop (or when this is implicitly called by our PyTorch Lightning trainer), this propagates gradients from our `loss` scalar back to all parameters in our model. If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.

See the code below as an example of how gradient propagation stops at tensors with `requires_grad = False`.

### Exercise - prepare ResNet for feature extraction

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪

First, you should complete the function below to do the following:

* Instantiate a `ResNet34` model using your class, and copy in weights from a pretrained model (you can use code from earlier here)
* Disable gradients for all layers
* Replace the final linear layer with a new linear layer, which has the same number of `in_features`, but a different number of `out_features` (given by the `n_classes` argument).

The dataclass we've defined containing training arguments is basically the same as the one we had for the convnet, the main difference is that we're now using the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). This is the dataset we'll be training our model on. It consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. See the link for more information.

### Exercise - write training loop for feature extraction

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 15-25 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

We now come to the final task - write a training loop for your ResNet model.

A few things to remember:

* You can optionally pass only a subset of your model's parameters to the optimizer when defining it, e.g. `Adam(model.out_layers[-1].parameters(), ...)`. But you don't have to do this, because the gradients for all other parameters have been frozen.
* Make sure you call `model.train()` before your training loop, and `model.eval()` before your validation loop. This changes the behaviour of your BatchNorm layers (recall from the previous section that BatchNorm behaves differently in eval mode, using lagged mean and variance estimators rather than computing mean and variance across the input data).
* Because the dataset is large, you might want nested progress bars: one for the epochs, and one for each epoch. Also, **make sure you're connected to GPU runtime rather than CPU.**

<details>
<summary>Spoilers - what kind of results should you get?</summary>

If you train the whole model rather than just the final layer, you should find accuracy increases very slowly, not getting very far above random chance. This reflects the fact that the model is trying to learn a new task (classifying images into 10 classes) from scratch, rather than just learning to extract features from images, and this takes a long time!

If you train just the final layer, your accuracy should reach around 70-80% by the first epoch. This is because the model is already very good at extracting features from images, and it just needs to learn how to turn these features into predictions for this new set of classes.

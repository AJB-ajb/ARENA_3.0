One strong piece of evidence for the former would be finding **circuits with SAEs**, in other words sets of latents in different layers of the transformer which communicate with each other, and explain some particular behaviour in an end-to-end way.

Rather than just drawing them randomly from a distribution and normalizing them, we'll be **sampling them with replacement from a set of input activations $h$, with sampling probabilities weighted by the squared $L_2$ loss of the autoencoder on each input**. Intuitively, this will make it more likely that our resampled neurons will represent feature directions that the autoencoder is currently doing a bad job of representing.\n","\n","The new resampling algorithm looks like the following - for each instance we:\n","\n","* Generate a batch of hidden data `h` from your SAE and compute its squared reconstruction loss `l2_squared`. It should have shape `(batch_size, n_inst)`.

One especially exciting one is the **Gated SAE**, described in detail in this paper from [DeepMind](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16014). We can motivate this architecture by starting with two observations\n","\n","1. **Empirically, features usually seem to want to be binary.** For instance, we often see features like \"is this about a basketball\" which are better thought of as \"off\" or \"on\" than occupying some continuous range from 0 to 1. In practice reconstructing the precise coefficients does matter, and they often seem important for indicating something like the model's confidence in a particular feature being present. But still, we'd ideally like an architecture which can learn this discontinuity.\n","\n","One easy option would be to have a discontinuous activation function in the hidden layer of our SAE, such as a **Jump ReLU**. This activation has a jump at some value $\\theta$, and could allow us to represent this nonlinearity.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wZqqQysfLrt2CFx4T/zzrdot3xexvcz3mqghn8\" width=\"240\">\n","\n","However, there's another problem which Jump ReLUs alone** won't solve:\n","\n","2. **SAEs suffer from [shrinkage](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3JuSjTZyMzaSeTxKk/addressing-feature-suppression-in-saes).** Recall that the actual objective we want is that the L0 \"norm\" (the number of non-zero elements) of the hidden layer is small, and we use the L1 norm as a proxy for this. The two loss term in the SAE loss function have conflicting goals: the reconstruction term wants to make the autoencoder good at reconstructing the input, and the sparsity term wants to shrink the magnitude of the hidden layer. This means that even when perfect reconstruction is possible with only a single hidden unit activated, the sparsity loss will bias the magnitude of this hidden unit to zero, and the reconstruction will be worse.  \n","\n","**_Note, JumpReLUs alone don't fix shrinkage, but JumpReLUs plus L0 penalty <u>does</u> fix shrinkage - we'll discuss this later in the chapter._\n","\n","This brings us to **Gated SAEs**, which seem to fix both problems by having a Heaviside term which applies a discontinuity, and decoupling this term from the magnitude term. Instead of our standard function for computing SAE activations:\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}):=\\operatorname{ReLU}\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{enc}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{dec}}\\right)+\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{enc}}\\right)\n","$$\n","\n","we instead use:\n","\n","$$\n","\\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}(\\mathbf{x}):=\\underbrace{\\mathbf{1} \\overbrace{\\left[\\mathbf{W}_{\\text {gate }}\\left(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{b}_{\\text {dec }}\\right)+\\mathbf{b}_{\\text {gate }}\\right)}^{\\pi_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})}>0]}_{\\mathbf{f}_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})} \\odot \\underbrace{\\operatorname{ReLU}\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{\\text {mag }}\\left(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{b}_{\\text {dec }}\\right)+\\mathbf{b}_{\\text {mag }}\\right)}_{\\mathbf{f}_{\\text {mag }}(\\mathbf{x})},\n","$$\n","where $\\mathbf{1}[\\cdot > 0]$ is the pointwise Heavisde step function and $\\odot$ is elementwise multiplication. The features' gate and activation magnitudes are computed by weight matrices, $W_{\\text{mag}}$ and $W_{\\text{gate}}$. Interestingly, if we tie the gated and magnitude weights as $\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{\\text {mag }}\\right)_{i j}:=\\left(\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{r}_{\\text {mag }}\\right)\\right)_i \\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{\\text {gate }}\\right)_{i j}$, then we can show that this is basically equivalent to a Jump ReLU activation function with a parameterized threshold value $\\theta$ (left as an exercise to the reader!).\n","\n","You might be wondering, how can we train this SAE? Ideally we'd place a sparsity penalty on the term $f_{\\text{gate}}(\\mathbf{x})$, since that's the thing which determines whether our activations will be zero or not. Unfortunately we can't do that, because gradients won't propagate through the Heaviside function (it's discontinuous). Instead, we apply a sparsity penalty to the preactivation $\\pi_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})$. So we have our loss function:\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {gated }}(\\mathbf{x}):=\\underbrace{\\|\\mathbf{x}-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}(\\mathbf{x}))\\|_2^2}_{\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {reconstruct }}}+\\underbrace{\\lambda\\left\\|\\operatorname{ReLU}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})\\right)\\right\\|_1}_{\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {sparsity }}}\n","$$\n","\n","However, there's a problem here. As long as the preactivation values $\\pi_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})$ are positive, reducing them will reduce the sparsity penalty without changing the reconstruction loss (all that matters for reconstruction is whether the preactivation values are positive or negative). So eventually they'll hit zero, and won't receive any more gradients (because the model's output will just always be zero from that point onwards). To combat this, we add an auxiliary loss term equal to the reconstruction loss when we swap out the true latent activations for the preactivation values $\\pi_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})$. This will add a gradient for the preactivations which pushes them up, offsetting the sparsity loss function which will only push those values down towards zero. We now have our final loss function:\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {gated }}(\\mathbf{x}):=\\underbrace{\\|\\mathbf{x}-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{f}}(\\mathbf{x}))\\|_2^2}_{\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {reconstruct }}}+\\underbrace{\\lambda\\left\\|\\operatorname{ReLU}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})\\right)\\right\\|_1}_{\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {sparsity }}}+\\underbrace{\\left\\|\\mathbf{x}-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{\\text {frozen }}\\left(\\operatorname{ReLU}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{\\text {gate }}(\\mathbf{x})\\right)\\right)\\right\\|_2^2}_{\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {aux }}}\n","$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"861rfElERm_D"},"source":["### Exercise - implement Gated SAEs\n","\n","```c\n","Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴\n","Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪\n","\n","You should spend up to 60 minutes on this exercise.\n","```\n","\n","Now, you have all the information you need to implement a Gated SAE and compare it to the standard model.

The answer is that this expression is a form of **kernel density estimation** (KDE), i.e. it approximates the pdf for a variable by smoothing out its empirical distribution. \n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/jumprelu-2.png\" width=\"620\">\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Some final notes about JumpReLU SAEs, before we move on to the actual exercises:\n","\n","- The nice thing about using L0 rather than L1 as a penalty is that we can target specific sparsity values.

When True, you don't substitute (which is sometimes what you want when caching activations)\n","- There's an analogous `run_with_saes` that works like `run_with_hooks`\n","- There's also `run_with_cache_with_saes` that works like `run_with_cache`, but allows you to cache any SAE activations you want\n","- You can use `ActivationStore` to get a large batch of activations at once\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Replicating SAE dashboards</summary>\n","\n","In this section, you'll replicate the 5 main components of the SAE dashboard: top logits tables, logits histogram, activation density plots, top activating sequences, and autointerp.

Under the hood, they work just like adding hooks in TransformerLens, only in this case our hooks are \"replace these activations with their SAE reconstructions\".\n","\n","There are a lot of other ways you can do SAE-hooked forward passes, which parallel the multiple way you can do regular hooked forward passes. For example, just like you can use `with model.hooks(fwd_hooks=...)` as a context manager to add hooks temporarily, you can also use `with model.saes(saes=...)` to run a forward pass with SAEs attached. And just like you can use `model.add_hook` and `model.reset_hooks`, you can also use `model.add_sae` and `model.reset_saes`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# FILTERS: ~py\n","\n","prompt = \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global\"\n","answer = \" priority\"\n","\n","# First see how the model does without SAEs\n","test_prompt(prompt, answer, gpt2)\n","\n","# Test our prompt, to see what the model says\n","with gpt2.saes(saes=[gpt2_sae]):\n","    test_prompt(prompt, answer, gpt2)\n","\n","# Same thing, done in a different way\n","gpt2.add_sae(gpt2_sae)\n","test_prompt(prompt, answer, gpt2)\n","gpt2.reset_saes()  # Remember to always do this!\n","\n","# Using `run_with_saes` method in place of standard forward pass\n","logits = gpt2(prompt, return_type=\"logits\")\n","logits_sae = gpt2.run_with_saes(prompt, saes=[gpt2_sae], return_type=\"logits\")\n","answer_token_id = gpt2.to_single_token(answer)\n","\n","# Getting model's prediction\n","top_prob, token_id_prediction = logits[0, -1].softmax(-1).max(-1)\n","top_prob_sae, token_id_prediction_sae = logits_sae[0, -1].softmax(-1).max(-1)\n","\n","print(f\"\"\"Standard model: top prediction = {gpt2.to_string(token_id_prediction)!r}, prob = {top_prob.item():.2%}\n","SAE reconstruction: top prediction = {gpt2.to_string(token_id_prediction_sae)!r}, prob = {top_prob_sae.item():.2%}\n","\"\"\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["FILTERS: soln,st\n","\n","<pre style=\"white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace\">Tokenized prompt: ['<|endoftext|>', 'Mit', 'igating', ' the', ' risk', ' of', ' extinction', ' from', ' AI', ' should', ' be', ' a', ' global']\n","Tokenized answer: [' priority']\n","\n","Performance on answer token:\n","<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Rank: </span><span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold\">0</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">        Logit: </span><span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold\">19.46</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> Prob: </span><span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold\">52.99</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">% Token: | priority|</span>\n","\n","Top 0th token.

It originated with the OpenAI paper [Language models can explain neurons in language models](https://openai.com/index/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models/), which showed that we could take a neuron from GPT-2 and use GPT-4 to generate explanations of its behaviour by showing it relevant text sequences and activations. This shows us one possible way to assess and categorize latents at scale, without requiring humans to manually inspect and label them (which would obviously be totally impractical to scale). You can also read about some more of the recent advancements made [here](https://blog.eleuther.ai/autointerp/) and [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8ev6coxChSWcxCDy8/self-explaining-sae-features).\n","\n","This scalable efficient categorization is one use-case, but there's also a second one: **SAE evaluations**. This is a topic we'll dive deeper into in later sections, but to summarize now: SAE evaluations are the ways we measure \"how good our SAE is\" in a varity of different ways. It turns out this is very hard, because any metric we pick is vulnerable to **Goodhearting** and not necessarily representative of what we want out of our SAEs. For example, it seems like sparser latents are often more interpretable (if reconstruction loss is held constant), which is why a common way to evaluate SAEs is along a **Pareto frontier of sparsity & reconstruction loss**. But what if sparsity doesn't lead to more interpretable latents (e.g. because of [feature absorption](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zBsxeZzd3cvuueMJ/paper-a-is-for-absorption-studying-feature-splitting-and))? **Autointerp provides an alternative way of evaluating SAE interpretability, because we can directly quantify how good our latent explanations are!** The idea is to convert latent explanations into a set of predictions on some test set of prompts, and then score the accuracy of those predictions. More interpretable latents should lead to better predictions, because the latents will tend to have monosemantic and human-interpretable patterns that can be predicted from their given explanations.\n","\n","For now though, we'll focus on just the first half of autointerp, i.e. the generation of explanations.

However, before we get into that, we first need to introduce a new concept - **attention SAEs**.\n","\n","Research done by [Kissane el al](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DtdzGwFh9dCfsekZZ/sparse-autoencoders-work-on-attention-layer-outputs) as part of the MATS program has shown that we can use SAEs on the output of attention layers, and it also works well: the SAEs learn sparse, interpretable latents, which gives us insight into what attention layers learn. Subsequent work trained SAEs on the attention output of every layer of GPT2Small; these are the SAEs we'll be using in today's exercises.\n","\n","Functionally, these SAEs work just like regular ones, except that they take the `z` output of the attention layer as input (i.e. after taking a linear combination of value vectors, but before projecting via the output matrix) rather than taking the residual stream or post-ReLU MLP activations. These `z` vectors are usually concatenated together across attention heads, for a single layer.\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Can you see why we take the attention output before projection via the output matrix, rather than after?</summary>\n","\n","It would be a waste of parameters. The encoder is a linear map from activation space to latent space, and the attention head's output `z @ W_O` can't have a larger rank than `z` (though it might have smaller rank), but it will be larger and hence will lead to less efficient training.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Can you guess why we concatenate across attention heads?</summary>\n","\n","We do this because heads might be in superposition, just like neurons in MLP layers. As well as a single attention head containing many latents, we could have a latent which is split across multiple attention heads. Evidence of shared attention head functionality abounds in regular models, for instance in the intro to mech interp ARENA exercises, we examined a 2-layer model where 2 heads in the second layer came together to form a copying head. In that case, we might expect to find latents which are split across both heads.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","However, one interesting thing about attention SAEs is that we also have to think about source tokens, not just the destination token. In other words, once we identify some attention latent that is present at a particular destination token, we still need to ask the question of which source tokens it came from.\n","\n","This leads us to the tool of **direct latent attribution** (which we'll abbreviate as \"DFA\" or \"direct feature attribution\", just so it doesn't get confused with direct logit attribution!). Just as in direct logit attribution (DLA) we ask which components wrote to the residual stream in ways which directly influenced certain logits, with DFA we can decompose the input to the destination token which caused that latent to fire.

We'll focus on trying to find **IOI features** - features which seem to activate on the indirect object identification pattern. You might already be familiar with this via the IOI exercises in ARENA. If not, it's essentially sentences of the form `\"When John and Mary went to the shops, John gave the bag to\"` -> `\" Mary\"`. Models like GPT2-Small are able to learn this pattern via the following algorithm:\n","\n","- **Duplicate token heads** in layers 0-3 attend from the second `\" John\"` token (we call it `S2`; the second subject) back to the first `\" John\"` token (`S1`), and store the fact that it's duplicated.\n","- **S-inhibition heads** in layers 7-8 attend from `\" to\"` back to the `\" John\"` token, and store information that this token is duplicated.\n","- **Name-mover heads** in layers 9-10 attend from `\" to\"` back to any non-duplicated names (using Q-composition with the output of the S-Inhibition heads to avoid attending to the duplicated `\" John\"` tokens). So they attend to `\" Mary\"`, and move this information into the unembedding space to be used as the model's prediction.\n","\n","Sadly, our SAEs aren't yet advanced enough to pick up on **S-inhibition features**. As discussed above, these mid-layer heads which read from & write to subspaces containing intermediate representations are pretty difficult to interpret. In fact, reading [this section](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FSTRedtjuHa4Gfdbr/attention-saes-scale-to-gpt-2-small#Introduction) of the LessWrong post analyzing our GPT2-Small attention SAEs, we find that the worst layers for \"% alive features interpretable\" as well as \"loss recovered\" are around 7 and 8, which is precisely the location of our S-Inhibition heads!\n","\n","However, the authors of that post were able to find **duplicate token features** as well as **name-mover featires**, and in the following exercises we'll replicate their work!\n","\n","Before we start, let's first make sure that the model can actually solve this sentence. To make our results a bit more robust (e.g. so we're not just isolating \"gender features\" or something), we'll control by using 4 different prompts: with \"John\" and \"Mary\" as answers flipped around, and also with the sentence structure flipped around (ABBA vs ABAB).

You might already have come across this via Anthropic's viral [Golden Gate Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude) model. Steering simply involves intervening on the model's activations during a forward pass, and adding some multiple of a feature's decoder weight into our residual stream (or possibly scaling the component that was already present in the residual stream, or just clamping this component to some fixed value). When choosing the value, we are usually guided by the maximum activation of this feature over some distribution of text (so we don't get too OOD).\n","\n","Sadly we can't quite replicate Golden Gate Claude with GemmaScope SAEs.

For example, imagine if you did really find a bigram feature that just caused the model to output \"Gate\" after \"Golden\" - steering on this would eventually just cause the model to output an endless string of \"Gate\" tokens (something like this in fact does happen for the 2 aforementioned features, and you can try it for yourself if you want). Instead, we want to look for a feature with a better **consistent activation heuristic value** - roughly speaking, this is the correlation between feature activations on adjacent tokens, so a high value might suggest a concept-level feature rather than a token-level one.

To address them each in turn:\n","\n","**TopK** SAEs use a different activation function: rather than $z = \\operatorname{ReLU}(W_{enc}(x-b_{dec}) + b_{enc})$, we compute them as $z = \\operatorname{TopK}(W_{enc}(x-b_{dec}))$, where $\\operatorname{TopK}$ returns the top $K$ elements of the input tensor, setting the rest to zero. This removes the need for the $L_1$ penalty (which tackles problems like [feature suppression](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3JuSjTZyMzaSeTxKk/addressing-feature-suppression-in-saes)), and allows us to set the $L_0$ value directly rather than tuning it to some specific value. It can also be composed with arbitrary activation functions.\n","\n","**JumpReLU** SAEs use the JumpReLU activation function in place of a regular ReLU. JumpReLU is just a ReLU with an extra step, and (often learnable) threshold parameter, i.e. $\\operatorname{JumpReLU}_\\theta(x) = xH(x-\\theta)$ where $\\theta$ is a learnable threshold parameter and $H$ is the Heaviside step function (equalling 1 when its argument is positive, and 0 otherwise).\n","\n","Intuitively, why might we expect this to perform better than regular ReLU SAEs? One reason is that empirically, seem to \"want to be binary\". For instance, we often see features like \"is this about a basketball\" which are better thought of as \"off\" or \"on\" than occupying some continuous range from 0 to 1. In practice reconstructing the precise coefficients does matter, and they often seem important for indicating something like the model's confidence in a particular feature being present. But still, we'd ideally like an architecture which can learn this discontinuity.\n","\n","JumpReLU is unfortunately difficult to train (since we have to resort to sneaky methods to get around the function's jump discontinuity, which makes it non-differentiable). As a result, many groups seem to have failed to replicate DeepMind's [initial paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14435).\n","\n","**Gated** SAEs are the most recent (as of writing) variant on the basic SAE architecture to be proposed, coming from another recent [DeepMind paper](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/88147/). They offer the same jump-discontinuity benefit as JumpReLU (in fact you can show that with a bit of weight tying Gated SAEs are equivalent to JumpReLUs), but they offer one other advantage too: they **decouple the jump discontinuity from the magnitude**. With JumpReLU functions there's only one axis to vary along, but ideally you'd want the freedom to independently determine whether a feature should be on or off, and what its magnitude should be when it's on. Gated SAEs accomplish this by having 2 separate encoder weight matrices, one for computing magnitude and one for masking. Like JumpReLUs, they're also discontinuous and need a special training objective function, but unlike JumpReLUs they've generally proven much easier to train. From Neel's [Extremely Opinionated Annotated List of My Favourite Mechanistic Interpretability Papers](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NfFST5Mio7BCAQHPA/an-extremely-opinionated-annotated-list-of-my-favourite#Sparse_Autoencoders):\n","\n","> \"I (very biasedly) think [[the DeepMind paper](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/88147/)] is worth reading as a good exemplar of how to rigorously evaluate whether an SAE change was an improvement, and because I recommend using Gated SAEs where possible.\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### End-to-End SAEs\n","\n","In the paper [Identifying Functionally Important Features with End-to-End Sparse Dictionary Learning](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xzJK3nENopiLmo77H/identifying-functionally-important-features-with-end-to-end), the authors propose a different way of training standard SAEs. Rather than using mean squared reconstruction error (MSE) of activations as the training objective, they use the KL divergence between the original output logits and the output logits we get when passing the SAE output through the rest of the network. The intuition here is that we want to identify the **functionally important features** which are actually important for explaining the model's behaviour on the training distribution. Minimizing MSE can be a good heuristic for this (because important features often need to be represented with high magnitude), but it's not directly getting at the thing we want to measure, and could be considered vulnerable to **Goodhart's Law** (\"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\").\n","\n","The full paper contains the results of experiments run on end-to-end (e2e) SAEs, compared to standard (local) SAEs. They find that e2e SAEs tend to require a smaller L0 for the same level of model performance captured, although they have much larger per-layer MSE (the authors suggest some ways to mitigate this, and find a balance between the local and end-to-end objectives)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Meta SAEs\n","\n","Meta SAEs are a special type of SAE, trained to reconstruct the decoder directions of a normal SAE. This allows us to find sparse reconstructions of the base SAE latents, in situations where the SAE latents aren't monosemantic. One reason why we might not expect them to be monosemantic is **feature absorption** - the SAE might learn a feature like \"starts with e\", but that feature fails to fire on \"elephant\" because there's already a learned feature for \"elephant\" that has absorbed the \"starts with e\" information. This is better for the model's sparsity (because it means the \"starts with e\" feature fires on one less word), but unfortunately it prevents our features from being monosemantic, and prevents our SAEs giving us a decomposition into a sparse set of causal mediators.\n","\n","The [paper](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TMAmHh4DdMr4nCSr5/showing-sae-latents-are-not-atomic-using-meta-saes) on Meta-SAEs finds the following key results:\n","\n","> - SAE latents can be decomposed into more atomic, interpretable meta-latents.\n","> - We show that when latents in a larger SAE have split out from latents in a smaller SAE, a meta SAE trained on the larger SAE often recovers this structure.\n","> - We demonstrate that meta-latents allow for more precise causal interventions on model behavior than SAE latents on a targeted knowledge editing task.\n","\n","You can visit the [dashboard](https://metasae.streamlit.app/?page=Feature+Explorer&feature=11329) which the authors built, that lets you explore meta-SAE latents."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Transcoders\n","\n","The MLP-layer SAEs we've looked at attempt to represent activations as a sparse linear combination of feature vectors; importantly, they only operate on activations **at a single point in the model**. They don't actually learn to perform the MLP layer's computation, rather they learn to reconstruct the results of that computation. It's very hard to do any weights-based analysis on MLP layers in superposition using standard SAEs, since many features are highly dense in the neuron basis, meaning the neurons are hard to decompose.\n","\n","In contrast, **transcoders** take in the activations before the MLP layer (i.e. the possibly-normalized residual stream values) and aim to represent the post-MLP activations of that MLP layer, again as a sparse linear combination of feature vectors. The transcoder terminology is the most common, although these have also been called **input-output SAEs** (because we take the input to some base model layer, and try to learn the output) and **predicting future activations** (for obvious reasons). Note that transcoders aren't technically autoencoders, because they're learning a mapping rather than a reconstruction - however a lot of our intuitions from SAEs carry over to transcoders.\n","\n","Why might transcoders be an improvement over standard SAEs? Mainly, they offer a much clearer insight into the function of a model's layers. From the [Transcoders LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YmkjnWtZGLbHRbzrP/transcoders-enable-fine-grained-interpretable-circuit):\n","\n","> One of the strong points of transcoders is that they decompose the function of an MLP layer into sparse, independently-varying, and meaningful units (like neurons were originally intended to be before superposition was discovered). This significantly simplifies circuit analysis.\n","\n","Intuitively it might seem like transcoders are solving a different (more complicated) kind of optimization problem - trying to mimic the MLP's computation rather than just reproduce output - and so they would suffer a performance tradeoff relative to standard SAEs. However, evidence suggests that this might not be the case, and transcoders might offer a pareto improvement over standard SAEs.\n","\n","In the section on **Circuits with SAEs**, we'll dive much deeper into transcoders, and how & why they work so well."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Bonus\n","\n","We've now finished the main content of this section!

In later sections we'll take deeper dives into specific methods for interpreting latents, but in this section we address a highly important topic - what about **circuits of SAAE latents**? Circuit analysis has already been somewhat successful in language model interpretability (e.g. see Anthropic's work on induction circuits, or the Indirect Object Identification paper), but many attempts to push circuit analysis further has hit speedbumps: most connections in the model are not sparse, and it's very hard to disentangle all the messy cross-talk between different components and residual stream subspaces. Circuit offer a better path forward, since we should expect that not only are individual latents generally sparse, they are also **sparsely connected** - any given latent should probably only have a downstream effect on a small number of other latents.\n","\n","Indeed, if this does end up being true, it's a strong piece of evidence that latents found by SAEs *are* the **fundamental units of computation** used by the model, as opposed to just being an interesting clustering algorithm. Of course we do already have some evidence for this (e.g. the effectiveness of latent steering, and the fact that latents have already revealed important information about models which isn't clear when just looking at the basic components), but finding clear latent circuits would be a much stronger piece of evidence."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Latent Gradients\n","\n","We'll start with an exercise that illustrates the kind of sparsity you can expect in latent connections, as well as many of the ways latent circuit analysis can be challenging. We'll be implementing the `latent_to_latent_gradients` function, which returns the gradients between all active pairs of latents belonging to SAEs in two different layers (we'll be using two SAEs from our `gpt2-small-res-jb` release). These exercises will be split up into a few different steps, since computing these gradients is deceptively complex.\n","\n","What exactly are latent gradients? Well, for any given input, and any 2 latents in different layers, we can compute the derivative of the second latent's activation with respect to the first latent. This takes the form of a matrix of partial derivatives, i.e. $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}$, and can serve as a linear proxy for how latents in an early layer contribute to latents in a later layer.

This is a bit risky when drawing conclusions from the results, because if your earlier SAE isn't very good at reconstructing its input then you might miss out on ways in which downstream latents are affected by upstream activations.

Well, one obvious answer is that it completes our end-to-end circuits picture (we've now got tokens -> latents -> other latents -> logits). But to give another answer, we can consider latents as having a dual nature: when looking back towards the input, they are **representations**, but when looking forward towards the logits, they are **actions**. We might expect sparsity in both directions, in other words not only should latents sparsely represent the activations produced by the input, they should also sparsely affect the gradients influencing the output. As you'll see when doing these exercises, this is partially the case, although not to the same degree as we saw extremely sparse token-to-latent or latent-to-latent gradients. One reason for that is that sparsity as representations is already included in the SAE's loss function (the L1 penalty), but there's no explicit penalty term to encourage sparsity in the latent gradients. Anthropic propose what this might look like in their [April 2024 update](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/april-update/index.html#attr-dl).\n","\n","However, despite the results for latent-to-logit gradients being less sparse than the last 2 exercises, they can still teach us a lot about which latents are important for a particular input prompt.

They don't actually learn to perform the MLP layer's computation, rather they learn to reconstruct the results of that computation. It's very hard to do any weights-based analysis on MLP layers in superposition using standard SAEs, since many latents are highly dense in the neuron basis, meaning the neurons are hard to decompose.\n","\n","In contrast, **transcoders** take in the activations before the MLP layer (i.e. the possibly-normalized residual stream values) and aim to represent the post-MLP activations of that MLP layer, again as a sparse linear combination of latent vectors. The transcoder terminology is the most common, although these have also been called **input-output SAEs** (because we take the input to some base model layer, and try to learn the output) and **predicting future activations** (for obvious reasons). Note that transcoders aren't technically autoencoders, because they're learning a mapping rather than a reconstruction - however a lot of our intuitions from SAEs carry over to transcoders.\n","\n","Why might transcoders be an improvement over standard SAEs? Mainly, they offer a much clearer insight into the function of a model's layers.

SAEs are analogous to a debugger that lets us set breakpoints at various locations in the program and read out variables. On the other hand, transcoders are analogous to a tool for replacing specific subroutines in this program with human-interpretable approximations.\n","\n","Intuitively it might seem like transcoders are solving a different (more complicated) kind of optimization problem - trying to mimic the MLP's computation rather than just reproduce output - and so they would suffer a performance tradeoff relative to standard SAEs.

In fact, we could only compute gradients between latents which were both alive in the same forward pass. One way we might have liked to deal with this is by just taking the dot product of the \"writing vector\" of one latent with the \"reading vector\" of another. For example, suppose our SAEs were trained on post-ReLU MLP activations, then we could compute: `W_dec[:, f1] @ W_out[layer1] @ W_in[layer2] @ W_enc[f2, :]` (where `f1` and `f2` are our earlier and later latent indices, `layer1` and `layer2` are our SAE layers, and `W_in`, `W_out` are the MLP input & output weight matrices for all layers). To make sense of this formula: the term `W_dec[:, f1] @ W_out[layer1]` is the \"writing vector\" being added to the residual stream by the first (earlier) latent, and we would take the dot product of this with `W_in[layer2] @ W_enc[f2, :]` to compute the activation of the second (later) latent. However, one slight frustration is that we're ignoring the later MLP layer's ReLU function (remember that the SAEs are reconstructing the post-ReLU activations, not pre-ReLU). This might seem like a minor point, but it actually gets to a core part of the limitation of standard SAEs when trained on layers which perform computation - **the SAEs are reconstructing a snapshot in the model, but they're not helping us get insight into the layer's actual computation process**.\n","\n","How do transcoders help us here? Well, since transcoders sit around the entire MLP layer (nonlinearity and all), we can literally compute the dot product between the \"writing vector\" and a downstream \"reading vector\" to figure out whether any given latent causes another one to be activated (ignoring layernorm).

To quote from their post:\n","\n","> ...we have some latent in some transcoder, and we want to interpret this transcoder latent without looking at the examples that cause it to activate. Our goal is to instead come to a hypothesis for when the latent activates by solely using the input-independent and input-dependent circuit analysis methods described above.\n","\n","By **input-independent circuit analysis**, they mean things like pullbacks and de-embeddings (i.e. things which are a function of just the model & transcoder's weights). By **input-dependent**, they specifically mean the **input-dependent influence**, which they define to be the elementwise product of the pullback to some earlier transcoder and the post-ReLU activations of that earlier transcoder. In other words, it tells you not just which earlier latents would affect some later latent when those earlier latents fire, but which ones *do* affect the later latent on some particular input (i.e. taking into account which ones actually fired).\n","\n","What's the motivation for this? Well, eventually we want to be able to understand latents when they appear in complex circuits, not just as individual units which respond to specific latents in the data. And part of that should involve being able to build up hypotheses about what a given latent is doing based on only its connection to other latents (or to specific tokens in the input). Just looking directly at the top activating examples can definitely be helpful, but not only is it sometimes [misleading](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zBsxeZzd3cvuueMJ/paper-a-is-for-absorption-studying-latent-splitting-and), it also can only tell you *what* a latent is doing, without giving much insight into *why*.\n","\n","To be clear on the rules:\n","\n","- You can't look at activations of a latent on specific tokens in specific example prompts.\n","- You can use input-dependent analysis e.g. the influence of some earlier latents on your target latent on some particular input (however you have to keep the input in terms of token IDs not tokens, because it's cheating to look at the actual content of prompts which activate any of your latents).\n","- You can use input-indepenent analysis e.g. a latent's de-embeddings or logit lens.\n","\n","We're making this a very open-ended exercise - we've written some functions for you above, but others you might have to write yourself, depending on what seems most useful for your analysis (e.g. we've not given you a function to compute pullback yet). If you want an easier exercise then you can use a latent which the post successfully reverse-engineered (e.g. latent 355, the 300th live latent in the transcoder), but for a challenge you can also try latent 479 (the 400th live latent in the transcoder,which the authors weren't able to reverse-engineer in their initial post).\n","\n","If you want a slightly easier version of the game, you can try a rule relaxation where you're allowed to pass your own sequences into the model to test hypotheses (you just can't do something like find the top activating sequences over a large dataset and decode them).

And some latents might seem very straightforward and interpretable when we apply automated interpretability to them, even though digging deeper reveals that the description would produce false negatives & misses out on important details.\n","\n","At the end of this section, we'll suggest an open-ended exercise where you take a single latent in some SAE and try to understand it as deeply as possible, using all these different lines of evidence.

Nowever, note that for our particular situation, the time taken for each UMAP should scale much slower than `O(n_data ** 2)`, so it should be possible to create maps from any of the SAEs you'll be loading in this section.\n","\n","If we're creating a 2D UMAP then you'll want to set `n_components=2`. The `n_neighbors` and `min_dist` arguments are hyperparameters of the UMAP algorithm, which control the trade off between local structure (how many neighbors each point has) and global structure (how far apart points are). You can see the `UMAP` docstrings for more on these. In the case of your 2D UMAP, you can use `n_neighbors_visual` and `min_dist_visual` as these arguments. See the next exercise for how the other arguments `n_neighbors_cluster` etc are used.\n","\n","A final note - so that the plot is more interpretable, we've included the fields `\"top_token_strs\"` and `\"description\"` in the hoverdata. The former should be the top 10 boosted tokens for each latent (i.e. the largest values when you pass the decoder matrix through the model's unembedding). The latter should be the autointerp description, taken from the corresponding dataframe in `autointerp_dfs` which is defined for you in the code above. These are both recommended, but optional - if you don't want to bother with this, then you can comment the field out of the `hoverdata` argument in the plotting function."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import hdbscan\n","from umap import UMAP\n","\n","\n","def compute_sae_umap_data(\n","    saes: dict[int, SAE],\n","    autointerp_dfs: dict[int, pd.DataFrame],\n","    sae_widths: list[int],\n","    model: HookedSAETransformer,\n","    n_neighbors_visual: int = 15,\n","    min_dist_visual: float = 0.05,\n","    find_clusters: bool = False,\n","    n_neighbors_cluster: float = 15,\n","    min_dist_cluster: float = 0.1,\n","    min_cluster_size: int = 3,\n","    batch_size: int = 1000,\n",") -> pd.DataFrame:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    This function will return a dataframe containing umap coordinates & other data (you can then use\n","    this to create a plot using the code immediately below).

To quote from the paper, the phenomenon of feature absorption is as follows:\n","\n","> - An SAE latent appears to track a human-interpretable concept (such as \"starts with E\").\n","> - That SAE latent fails to activate on seemingly arbitrary examples (eg \"Elephant\").\n","> - We find \"absorbing\" latents which weakly project onto the feature direction and causally mediate in-place of the main latent (eg: an \"elephants\" latent absorbs the \"starts with E\" feature direction, and then the SAE no longer fires the \"starts with E\" latent on the token \"Elephant\", as the \"elephants\" latent now encodes that information, along with other semantic elephant-related features).\n","\n","Note that feature absorption also complicates the picture of feature splitting we gave above. In the view of feature splitting, a single latent in a narrow SAE can split into multiple more specific latents in a wider SAE. In this picture, our ability to predict SAE activations is still good, and we should expect to find sparse circuits in our model. But feature absorption is a problem which still persists even at large SAE widths, and it might impair not only our ability to predict SAE activations, but also to find sparse circuits (because our SAE no longer gives is a decomposition with a sparse set of causal mediators). Furthermore, feature absorption seems like a problem which stems directly from the sparsity penalty (since it allows the \"starts with E\" feature to fire less, without making the \"Elephant\" feature fire more), making it very hard to fix.\n","\n","Here's a diagram which illustrates the phenomenon of feature absorption:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/feature-absorption-v2.png\" width=\"600\">\n","\n","The work done in this paper primarily identifies and characterizes the problem of feature absorption.

It turns out this is very hard, because any metric we pick is vulnerable to **Goodhearting** and not necessarily representative of what we want out of our SAEs. For example, it seems like sparser latents are often more interpretable (if reconstruction loss is held constant), which is why a common way to evaluate SAEs is along a **Pareto frontier of latent sparsity & reconstruction loss**. But what if sparsity doesn't lead to more interpretable latents (e.g. because of [feature absorption](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zBsxeZzd3cvuueMJ/paper-a-is-for-absorption-studying-feature-splitting-and))? **Autointerp provides an alternative way of evaluating SAE interpretability, because we can directly quantify how good our latent explanations are!** The idea is to convert latent explanations into a set of predictions on some test set of prompts, and then score the accuracy of those predictions. More interpretable latents should lead to better predictions, because the latents will tend to have monosemantic and human-interpretable patterns that can be predicted from their given explanations.\n","\n","When scoring, we want to balance between **recall** (identifying text where the latent activates) and **precision** (avoiding false positives). For example, suppose we have a latent that fires on the word \"stop\", in phrases like \"don't stop\" or \"won't stop\". We might have the following 2 types of incorrect types of explanation:\n","\n","| Description                                                                 | Recall | Precision | Explanation |\n","|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n","| *'The latent activates on the word \"stop\"'*                               | High   | Low       | This identifies all positive examples, but also has many false positives. |\n","| *'The latent activates on the word \"stop\" in the phrase \"don't stop\"'*   | Low    | High      | This only identifies half the positive examples, but has no false positives. |\n","\n","These can be pretty difficult problems to solve. For example, in order to fix the problem of low precision, we'd need to exhibit example sequences containing the word \"stop\" in contexts other than \"don't stop\" or \"won't stop\", showing the model that the activations here are zero. Unfortunately, it's not obvious how to generate these false positive examples, because the sequences we're using in our autointerp are usually either sampled from the latent's top activating sequences (meaning they'll only contain \"stop\" inside phrases \"don't stop\" or \"won't stop\") or drawn randomly from the full dataset (in which case we shouldn't expect them to contain the word \"stop\" with particularly high frequency). These problems may well become worse as we scale to larger SAEs and sparser, more specific latents.\n","\n","If you've not already loaded in the following model & SAE from earlier sections, then run the code block below to do so:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# FILTERS: ~py\n","\n","gpt2 = HookedSAETransformer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2-small\", device=device)\n","\n","gpt2_sae = SAE.from_pretrained(\n","    release=\"gpt2-small-res-jb\",\n","    sae_id=\"blocks.7.hook_resid_pre\",\n","    device=str(device),\n",")[0]\n","\n","gpt2_act_store = ActivationsStore.from_sae(\n","    model=gpt2,\n","    sae=gpt2_sae,\n","    streaming=True,\n","    store_batch_size_prompts=16,\n","    n_batches_in_buffer=32,\n","    device=str(device),\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Exercise - implement autointerp scoring\n","\n","```c\n","Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪\n","Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪\n","\n","You should spend up to 30-45 minutes on this exercise.\n","```\n","\n","There are several different methods of scoring that have been explored in the literature. For example, we have [simulation scoring](https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/neuron-explainer/paper/index.html#sec-algorithm-explain) (from the original OpenAI \"Language models can explain neurons in language models\" paper) which assigns an activation to each token in a text, then measures the correlation between predicted and real activations. However, we'll be using a slightly easier-to-implement method: **detection**, i.e. giving the model a random sample of sequences (some of which are drawn from its top activating sequences, and others randomly from our dataset) and asking it to classify whether each sequence contains the latent in question. We can then measure the accuracy of its predictions - for example, if we pick 5 random sequences and 3 top activating sequences (ordered so that #1, #3, #7 are the top activating sequences), and our model predicted #1, #3, #6, then we'd have a score of 6/8 = 75% (since all sequences were correctly classified except for #6 and #7).\n","\n","We've set up some infrastructure for you below, to help you get started with autointerp scoring.

Bonus - make improvements to autointerp\n","\n","This is a very barebones implementation of autointerp, and could be improved in a number of ways. We list a few below, you're welcome to try any of these as well as other ideas you can think of!\n","\n","- **Use asyncio to speed up API queries.** The data gathering is parallelized across latents (most of the computation time is in the forward pass, not the for loop over latents to get max activations), but the same isn't true for querying the OpenAI API - this is currently implemented in a for loop, which is pretty inefficient. The operation of querying OpenAI's API is I/O bottlenecked, meaning you should be able to make it faster using libraries like `asyncio`. Can you get this working? (Note, this particular extension might not be well suited to working in a Colab or Jupyter notebook.)\n","- **Use explanations for generation.** Can you set up a third pipeline (alongside generation & scoring) which takes in the explanations produced during the generation phase, and uses them to produce sequences which the model thinks is likely to cause the latent to activate (as described by EleutherAI [here](https://blog.eleuther.ai/autointerp/#:~:text=Generation)). Does your model produce false positives in these cases? If so, can you use those examples in your generation phase to improve your explanation precision, reducing the number of false positive classifications?\n","- **Measure precision using latent neighbours.** Again as described by EleutherAI [here](https://blog.eleuther.ai/autointerp/#:~:text=Neighbors) - can you measure the precision of your explanations by finding latents with high decoder cosine similarity to each other, and seeing whether the explanation is sufficient to distinguish between whether a sequence activates one latent or the other? To take a different perspective, can you take top activating sequences from neighbouring latents, and use them as false positives in your generation phase to help improve the precision of your explanations?\n","- **Benchmark autointerp against neurons / random latents.** Anthropic [found](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html#appendix-automated-setup) that autointerp on SAE latents consistently outperformed autointerp on transformer neurons or randomly initialized latents (which is a good sign for our SAE latents being interpretable and monosemantic!). However, they found that autointerp on randomized SAE latents performed better than one might expect, because even random latents will display patterns when you take the top-k over a very large dataset (e.g. always firing on the same token or something). Can you replicate these results? What do you think the results say about autointerp and SAEs as a whole?\n","- **Incorporating more information.** Can you add to the generation prompt in ways suggested by EleutherAI, such as (1) adding the top logits boosted by this latent, (2) giving the quantized activation values for each token, (3) including example explanations in your prompt which illustrate the different kinds of latents you might encounter (e.g. token-level, substring-level, or concept-level with high consistent activation heuristic), or (4) using chain of thought to improve the quality of the model's explanations, for example:\n","\n","```plaintext\n","Step 1: List a couple activating and contextual tokens you find interesting.

To summarize, patch scoping involves taking a prompt like `\"The meaning of X is\"` and then generating output from the same model which the SAE was trained on, steering on the token `X` in the direction of the SAE latent. Effectively we're taking advantage of the model's own internal representations to get it to define a latent for us, as opposed to just using a different model to automate assessments of latents based on their activations.\n","\n","We'll be using the instruction-tuned Gemma 2B model for this exercise, so before we start the exercise we'll need to briefly address instruction tuned models and how they work.

It improves model performance not only on specific tasks, but on following instructions in general. Note that instruction tuning is not the same thing as RLHF - it doesn't require any RL in the optimization process, it's just fine-tuning in the same way as you might have performed the fine-tuning exercises in the first chapter of ARENA material (when we studied image classifiers).\n","\n","The training data in instruction tuning ususally consists of 3 elements:\n","\n","- An instruction: A natural language text input that specifies a given task. For example, “translate this sentence from English to Spanish.”\n","- Additional information: Optional, supplementary information that provides context relevant to the task at hand. For example, an input for a reading comprehension task might include a brief passage (and then instruct the model to answer a given question about it).\n","- Desired output: The target output—response—for the given prompt, per the instructions and context provided. This will serve as a ground truth against which the model’s predictions are evaluated and optimized.\n","\n","For example, here's an example from the [UltraChat dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k?row=1) (with some of the content removed for brevity):\n","\n","```python\n","[\n","    {\n","        \"content\": \"Here is a piece of text: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — In the final game of their historic match, Google's artificially intelligent Go-playing computer system has defeated Korean grandmaster Lee Sedol, finishing the best-of-five series with four wins and one loss.\\nThe win puts an exclamation point on a significant moment for artificial intelligence. Over the last twenty-five years, machines have beaten the best humans [...] There are holes in its education.

On the other hand, Lee Sedol can adjust his strategy based on his opponent's previous moves, but AlphaGo can't do so until it is retrained by its creators. Additionally, Lee Sedol was able to draw on his intuition and adapt to what he saw from his opponent in previous games, something AlphaGo can't do yet.

From Joseph Bloom:\n","\n","> SAEs are an unsupervised method which attempts to trade off reconstruction accuracy against interpretability, which we achieve by inducing activation sparsity. Since we don’t have good metrics for interpretability / reconstruction quality, it’s hard to know when we are actually optimizing what we care about. On top of this, we’re trying to pick a good point on the pareto frontier between interpretability and reconstruction quality which is a hard thing to assess well. The main objective is to have your SAE learn a population of sparse latents (which are likely to be interpretable) without having some dense latents (latents which activate all the time and are likely uninterpretable) or too many dead latents (latents which never fire).\n","\n","In order to help us train SAEs, we've developed a large number of metrics which can be logged while we're training - we'll be discussing more of these later. Many of these metrics are also relevant when performing **SAE evaluations** - in other words, not trying to measure performance improvements during training, but trying to measure the performance of SAEs post-training in order to assess the beneficial impact of new SAE architectures or training techniques. However, we should be conscious of the fact that different considerations go into metrics for post-training evals vs metrics during training - in particular that post-training metrics only need to be computed once, but it's more important that they tell us a clear and detailed story. For example, techniques like autointerp scoring are promising measures of SAE interpretability, but in their current form are too costly to be performed during training.\n","\n","Important note before we move on - it's important to draw a distinction between **level 1 thinking** and **level 2 thinking**. In this context, level 1 thinking is about interpreting metrics at face value and trying to find training setups which lead to optimal tradeoffs / positions on the Pareto frontier. Level 2 is about asking whether these proxy objectives actually correspond to getting us the SAEs we want, or whether they'll come apart from each other in undesireable ways. For example, **feature absorption** is one potential issue in SAEs, which casts doubt on the effectiveness of the sparsity penalty. However, these topics are mostly explored in chapter 3 of this material (where we take deep dives into topics like latent absorption, autointerp, latent splitting, etc) as well as the second half of this chapter (where we discuss evals post-training, rather than evals during training). In the first half of this chapter, most of the time you should be thinking at level 1."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Training with SAELens"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Like with so many things, `SAELens` makes training your SAEs relatively straightforward. The code for training is essentially:\n","\n","```python\n","from sae_lens import LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig, SAETrainingRunner\n","\n","runner_cfg = LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig(...)\n","runner = SAETrainingRunner(runner_cfg)\n","sae = runner.run()\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Training config\n","\n","The `LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig` class contains all the parameters necessary to specify how your SAE gets trained. This includes many of the parameters that went into the SAE config (in fact, this class contains a method `get_base_sae_cfg_dict()` which returns a dictionary that can be used to create the associated `SAEConfig` object). However, it also includes many other arguments which are specific to the training process itself. You can see the full set of config parameters in the source code for `LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig`, however for our purposes we can group them into ~7 main categories:\n","\n","1. **Data generation** - everything to do with how the data we use to train the SAE is generated & batched. Recall that your SAEs are trained on the activations of a base TransformerLens model, so this includes things like the model name (which should point to a model [supported by TransformerLens](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/model_properties_table.html)), hook point in the model, dataset path (which should reference a HuggingFace dataset), etc. We've also included `d_in` in this category since it's uniquely determined by the hook point you're training on.\n","2. **SAE architecture** - everything to do with the SAE architecture, which isn't implied by the data generation parameters. This includes things like `d_sae` (which you are allowed to use, although in practice we often specify `expansion_factor` and then `d_sae` is defined as `d_in * expansion_factor`), which activation function to use, how our weights are initialized, whether we subtract the decoder bias `b_dec` from the input, etc.\n","3. **Activations store** - everything to do with how the activations are stored and processed during training. Recall we used the `ActivationsStore` class earlier when we were generating the latent dashboards for our model. During training we also use an instance of this class to store and process batches of activations to feed into our SAE. We need to specify things like how many batches we want to store, how many prompts we want to process at once, etc.\n","4. **Training hyperparameters (standard)** - these are the standard kinds of parameters you'd expect to see in an other ML training loop: learning rate & learning rate scheduling, betas for Adam optimizer, etc.\n","5. **Training hyperparameters (SAE-specific)** - these are all the parameters which are specific to your SAE training. This means various coefficients like the $L_1$ penalty (as well as warmups for these coefficients), as well as things like the resampling protocol - more on this later. Certain other architectures (e.g. gated) might also come with additional parameters that need specifying.\n","6. **Logging / evals** - these control how frequently we log data to Weights & Biases, as well as how often we perform evaluations on our SAE (more on evals in the second half of this exercise set!). Remember that when we talk about evals during training, we're often talking about different kinds of evals than we perform post-training to compare different SAEs to each other (although there's certainly a lot of overlap).\n","7. **Misc** - this is a catchall for anything else you might want to specify, e.g. how often you save your model checkpoints, random seeds, device & dtype, etc."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Logging, checkpointing & saving SAEs\n","\n","For any real training run, you should be **logging to Weights and Biases (WandB)**. This will allow you to track your training progress and compare different runs. To enable WandB, set `log_to_wandb=True`. The `wandb_project` parameter in the config controls the project name in WandB. You can also control the logging frequency with `wandb_log_frequency` and `eval_every_n_wandb_logs`. A number of helpful metrics are logged to WandB, including the sparsity of the SAE, the mean squared error (MSE) of the SAE, dead latents, and explained variance. These metrics can be used to monitor the training progress and adjust the training parameters. We'll discuss these metrics more in later sections.\n","\n","**Checkpoints** allow you to save a snapshot of the SAE and sparsitity statistics during training. To enable checkpointing, set `n_checkpoints` to a value larger than 0. If WandB logging is enabled, checkpoints will be uploaded as WandB artifacts. To save checkpoints locally, the `checkpoint_path` parameter can be set to a local directory.\n","\n","Once you have a set of SAEs that you're happy with, your next step is to share them with the world! SAELens has a `upload_saes_to_huggingface()` function which makes this easy to do. You'll need to upload a dictionary where the keys are SAE ids, and the values are either `SAE` objects or paths to an SAE that's been saved using the `sae.save_model()` method (you can use a combination of both in your dictionary).

The goal is to monitor how these two different objectives are being balanced, and hopefully find pareto-improvements for them! For reconstruction loss, you want to pay particular attention to **MSE loss**, **CE loss recovered** and **explained variance**. For sparsity, you want to look at the L0 and L1 statistics, as well as the activations histogram (more on that below, since it's more nuanced than \"brr line go up/down\"!).\n","\n","The L1 coefficient is the primary lever you have for managing the tradeoff between accurate reconstruction and sparsity. Too high and you get lots of dead latents (although this is mediated by L1 warmup if using a scheduler - see below), too low and your latents will be dense and polysemantic rather than sparse and interpretable.\n","\n","Another really important point when considering the tradeoff between these two metrics - it might be tempting to use a very high L1 coefficient to get nice sparse interpretable latents, but if this comes at a cost of high reconstruction loss, then there's a real risk that **you're not actually learning the model's true behaviour.** SAEs are only valuable when they give us a true insight into what the model's representations actually are, and doing interpretability without this risks being just a waste of time. See discussion [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tEPHGZAb63dfq2v8n/how-useful-is-mechanistic-interpretability) between Neel Nanda, Ryan Greenblat & Buck Schlegris for more on this point (note that I don't agree with all the points made in this post, but it raises some highly valuable ideas that SAE researchers would do well to keep in mind).\n","\n","#### ...but metrics can sometimes be misleading\n","\n","Although metrics in one of these two groups will often tell a similar story (e.g. explained variance will usually be high when MSE loss is small), they can occasionally detach, and it's important to understand why this might happen. Some examples:\n","\n","- L0 and L1 both tell you about sparsity, but latent shrinkage makes them detach (it causes smaller L1, not L0)\n","- MSE loss and KL div / downstream CE both tell you about reconstruction, but they detach because one is myopic and the other is not\n","\n","As well as being useful to understand these specific examples, it's valuable to put yourself in a skeptical mindset, and understand why these kinds of problems can arise. New metrics are being developed all the time, and some of them might be improvements over current ones while others might carry entirely new and unforseen pitfalls!\n","\n","#### Dead latents, resampling & ghost gradients\n","\n","**Dead latents** are ones that never fire on any input. These can be a big problem during training, because they don't receive any gradients and so represent permanently lost capacity in your SAE. Two ways of dealing with dead latents, which Anthropic have described in various papers and update posts:\n","\n","1. **Ghost gradients** - this describes the method of adding an additional term to the loss, which essentially gives dead latents a gradient signal that pushes them in the direction of explaining more of the autoencoder's residual. Full technical details [here](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/jan-update/index.html#dict-learning-resampling).\n","2. **Resampling** - at various timesteps we take all our dead latents and randomly re-initialize them to values which help explain more of the residual (specifically, we will randomly select inputs which the SAE fails to reconstruct, and then set dead featurs to be the SAE hidden states corresponding to those inputs).\n","\n","These techniques are both useful, however they've been reassessed in the time after they were initially introduced, and are now not seen to be as critical as they once were (especially [ghost grads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/march-update/index.html#dl-update)). Instead, we use more standard techniques to avoid dead latents, specifically a combination of an appropriately small learning rate and an L1 warmup. We generally recommend people use resampling and not ghost gradients, but to take enough care with your LR and L1 warmup to avoid having to rely on resampling.\n","\n","Assuming we're not using ghost gradients, resampling is controlled by the following 3 parameters:\n","\n","- `feature_sampling_window`, which is how often we resample neurons\n","- `dead_feature_window`, which is the size of the window over which we count dead latents each time we resample. This should be smaller than `feature_sampling_window`\n","- `dead_feature_threshold`, which is the threshold below which we consider a latent to be dead & resample it\n","\n","#### Dense latents & learning rates\n","\n","Dense latents are the opposite problem to dead latents: if your learning rate is too small or L1 penalty too small, you'll fail to train latents to the point of being sparse. A dense latent is one that fires too frequently (e.g. on >1/100 or even >1/10 tokens). These latents seem generally uninterpretable, but can help with youre reconstruction loss immensely - essentially it's a way for the SAEs to smuggle not-particularly-sparse possibly-nonlinear computation into your SAE.\n","\n","It can be difficult to balance dense and dead latents during training. Generally you want to drop your learning rate as far down as it will go, without causing your latents to be dense and your training to be super slow.\n","\n","Note - what (if any) the right number of dense or dead latents should be in any situation is very much an open question, and depends on your beliefs about the underlying latent distribution in question. One way we can investigate this question is to try and train SAEs in a simpler domain, where the underlying latents are easier to guess about (e.g. OthelloGPT, or TinyStories - both of which we'll discuss later in this chapter).\n","\n","#### Interpreting the latent density histogram\n","\n","This section is quoted directly from Joseph Bloom's [excellent post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/f9EgfLSurAiqRJySD/open-source-sparse-autoencoders-for-all-residual-stream#Why_can_training_Sparse_AutoEncoders_be_difficult__) on training SAEs:\n","\n","> Latent density histograms are a good measure of SAE quality. We plot the log10 latent sparsity (how often it fires) for all latents. In order to make this easier to operationalize, I’ve drawn a diagram that captures my sense of the issues these histograms help you diagnose. Latent density histograms can be broken down into:\n","> - **Too Dense**:  dense latents will occur at a frequency > 1 / 100. Some dense-ish latents are likely fine (such as a latent representing that a token begins with a space) but too many is likely an issue.\n","> - **Too Sparse**: Dead latents won’t be sampled so will turn up at log10(epsilon), for epsilon added to avoid logging 0 numbers. Too many of these mean you’re over penalizing with L1.\n","> - **Just-Right**: Without too many dead or dense latents, we see a distribution that has most mass between -5 or -4 and -3 log10 latent sparsity.

As we mention in the previous section on metrics, it's important not to over-interpret an SAE which doesn't explain the majority of the model's true performance, because at that point we're learning things about our SAE but not about our model!\n","\n","It's also good to be aware of concepts like **feature splitting** when choosing width. You might still get interpretable latents for a variety of different widths, even if those latents are often related to each other via some kind of feature splitting. **Feature absorption** is a different (possibly more severe) kind of problem, which might happen more with wider SAEs but could in theory happen at any width.\n","\n","#### Gated models\n","\n","We've discussed gated models in previous sections, in comparison to other architectures like standard or topk.

See [this tutorial](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/pretokenizing_datasets.ipynb) for information on how to pre-tokenize your own dataset, if the one you're working with isn't pre-tokenized.

How will this change its induction circuits?</summary>\n","\n","The model has **shortformer positional embeddings**, meaning we subtract the positional information from the residual stream before computing the value vectors in the attention layer. This means that the SAE features won't directly contain positional information (although it won't stop you from finding things like previous-token features, because these still exist even if they don't perform pointer arithmetic by actually moving positional information from one token to the next).\n","\n","When it comes to induction: shortformer positional embeddings mean that induction heads can't be formed from Q-composition, only K-composition. This should help narrow down your search when looking for induction circuits.\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","Some tips:\n","\n","- You might want to experiment with different expansion factors for your attention SAEs, since the appropriate expansion factor will be different depending on the model you're training & hook point you're looking at.\n","- You'll need a different dataset, which either isn't pretokenized or whose tokenization matches the tokenizer of the model you're training on. You can check the latter with `model.cfg.tokenizer_name`, and see if any of the pretokenized datasets [here](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/docs/training_saes.md#list-of-pretokenized-datasets) support this tokenizer.\n","\n","We've given you some reasonable default parameters below, to get you started.

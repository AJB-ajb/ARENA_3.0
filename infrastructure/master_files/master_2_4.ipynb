A value head is basically just a simple classifier model which we stick to one of the policy network's internal activations. You can think of this as a kind of feature extraction.

We can attach a hook function to the residual stream at the final layer, and have it apply our value head to the residual stream values & store the output externally. Then we can use `model.run_with_hooks` to get our logits like normal, and fetch our value estimate from the external storage object.\n","\n","We're used to using hook functions during inference mode to perform causal interventions or compute statistical functions of our activations, but they can also be used during training mode to perform computations which are part of the autograd's computational graph.\n","\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0DGl6d01qDvd"},"source":["### Exercise - implement `TransformerWithValueHead`\n","\n","```c\n","Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪\n","Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪\n","\n","You should spend up to 15-25 minutes on this exercise.\n","```\n","\n","Here is a diagram of your implementation.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/value-head-3.png\" width=\"600\">\n","\n","First define `self.base_model` and `self.value_head` in your init step (reminder that you should use `HookedTransformer.from_pretrained` to load in a pretrained model).

But if we're working with reward functions that could be much higher variance such as the number of periods in a generated sequence, then we should normalize.\n","\n","Note - we're not super strict about this function; the denominator being `std + eps` or `(var + eps).sqrt()` are both fine."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"ok","timestamp":1706293226664,"user":{"displayName":"Callum McDougall","userId":"13944815271305687103"},"user_tz":0},"id":"7aH11E-wqNE2","outputId":"fdb45ad0-03ca-44ae-dc91-cdb0c8ea1b82"},"outputs":[],"source":["def normalize_reward(reward: Float[Tensor, \"batch\"], eps=1e-5) -> Float[Tensor, \"batch\"]:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Normalizes the reward function values over the batch of sequences.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # EXERCISE\n","    # raise NotImplementedError()\n","    # EXERCISE END\n","    # SOLUTION\n","    return (reward - reward.mean()) / (reward.std() + eps)\n","    # SOLUTION END\n","\n","\n","if MAIN:\n","    # Test your reward normalization function\n","    reward = 10 + 5 * t.randn(10_000)\n","    reward_normalized = normalize_reward(reward)\n","    assert reward_normalized.mean().abs() < 1e-4\n","    assert (reward_normalized.std() - 1).abs() < 1e-4\n","    # Test edge case of zero reward\n","    reward = t.zeros(5)\n","    reward_normalized = normalize_reward(reward)\n","    assert reward_normalized.abs().sum() < 1e-4\n","\n","    print(\"All tests for `normalize_reward` passed!\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"C9XqIDJkqN4H"},"source":["## RLHF training args\n","\n","We've given you a bunch of training args to use for RLHF.

Can you go even larger?\n","\n","See [this page](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/model_properties_table.html) for a table of model properties, for all models currently supported by TransformerLens. Note that if you use different model classes then you might need to change some parts of your code (e.g. if the name of the hook point where you added the value head happens to be different). You might also need to make other adjustments e.g. a smaller batch size (or a larger number of minibatches per batch, which is equivalent to smaller minibatch sizes).\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Differential Learning Rates / Frozen Layers\n","\n","When doing any kind of finetuning, it's common practice to either freeze earlier layers or have a smaller learning rate for them. You may have seen this in the feature extraction with ResNet34 exercises in the first week. In the exercises here we've trained all layers of the model equally, but you might want to play around with differential learning rates.\n","\n","Note that you can accomplish this using parameter groups - we already used parameter groups above to have a different learning rate for our base model and value head. It should be relatively straightforward to extend this to splitting parameters over different layers into different groups (hint - you can use `itertools.chain` to convert several iterables into a single iterable).\n","\n","You can also try entirely freezing earlier layers - this might also reduce your memory usage, and allow you to train larger models without getting cuda errors.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Hyperparameter sweeps\n","\n","You can do this to find the best possible hyperparamters for your RLHF training. Don't just measure on reward, can you use some combination of reward and avg kl diff to create a better metric? Can you use wandb's built-in [Bayesian search methods](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/sweep-config-keys#bayesian-search) to more effectively sweep?\n","\n","Note - don't forget **temperature** when it comes to hyperparameter tuning. Temperature has an important effect on how the model learns, e.g. if the temperature is too high then the model will produce very high-variance outputs which will have very high KL with the reference distribution, and it'll be more likely to collapse into some incoherent mode.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Adaptive KL penalty\n","\n","The KL divergence penalty coefficient can be modified adaptively based on the KL divergence between the current policy and the previous policy. If the KL divergence is outside a predefined target range, we can adjust the penalty coefficient to bring it closer to the target range.

Note that these instructions have been provided externally, so they've not yet been tested and might not work particularly well.\n","\n","1. Get a supervised baseline\n","    * [Here](https://zenodo.org/records/1168855) is a link to download the dataset for the TL;DR challenge containing posts from the Reddit corpus. Each post contains keys `content` and `summary` which are the original post and the human-written summary respectively.\n","    * You should throw out all summaries shorter than 24 tokens or longer than 48 tokens (to diminish the effects of length on quality); and choose a random subset of ~100k summaries to train on.\n","    * Run training to maximize the log-likelihood of these summaries.\n","2. Get reward model by training supervised baseline on human feedback\n","    * Download comparison data with the code `azcopy copy \"https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/summarize-from-feedback/dataset/*\" . --recursive`\n","    * Modify GPT-2 architecture by adding a randomly-initialized **reward head** at the end of your model.\n","        * Architecturally this is similar to the value head from earlier, but it's not the same thing - here we're trying to learn what the human reward will be; we're not doing RL yet.\n","    * Train your model (starting with base model given by supervised baseline weights, and reward head randomly initialized) to minimize `loss = log(sigmoid(reward_model(summary_0) - reward_model(summary_1)))`, `summary_0` is preferred by a human labeler (this data should be in the comparison data you downloaded).\n","    * You should normalize reward model outputs, like we normalized rewards in RLHF in previous exercises.\n","3. Fine-tune supervised baseline using PPO with reward model.\n","    * For these exercises we suggest using a larger model, ideally GPT2-Large or bigger. Remember you can freeze weights! Regardless, this will still take longer to train than your previous models.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### Interp on RLHF'd models\n","\n","Currently, very little mechanistic interpretability research ahs focused on RLHF'd models. In [this blog post](https://blog.eleuther.ai/trlx-exploratory-analysis/), Curt Tigges walks through an example of how we can use mech interp to analyze a model which has been finetuned with a sentiment based reward function using trlX.\n","\n","The flavour of the actual mech interp done here is very similar to the indirect object identification exercises you might have done during the transformers & interp week. If you didn't do these exercises, we recommend you do them before diving deep into this material.\n","\n","Lastly, here's a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eUdvlJNqY9X0NAw9UUseZz6dFyRklCcOHQy8x3CbcBk/edit?usp=sharing) brainstorming some ideas for RLHF interpretability.

In other words, after a certain number of iterations of (rollout phase, learning phase), they add a third reward model learning phase, where the current policy generates many pairs of trajectories of some fixed timestep and the human rater chooses which one is best.

To test scalable alignment techniques, the authors trained a model to summarize entire books, by first summarizing small sections of a book, then summarizing those summaries into a higher-level summary, and so on. A demonstration can be found [here](https://openai.com/research/summarizing-books).

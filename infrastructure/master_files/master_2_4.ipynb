This means we don't really have a concept of discount factors here - the reward only comes once, and as soon as it comes our episode terminates.\n","\n","The value function $V(s_t)$ is an estimate of the expected sum of future rewards (up to the end of the episode), which in this case means it's an estimate of what the reward will be once we get to the end of the sequence. We'll be adding a value head to our transformer model to estimate this value function (more on this later).\n","\n","> Note - a key part of RLHF is the actual gathering of and learning from human feedback, in order to train the reward function. We're not going to be doing that here, instead we'll be working with a fixed reward function.

We compute our objective function (which is the sum of the same 3 terms as yesterday) and perform a gradient step wrt it.\n","\n","The only new element is the **KL prediction shift penalty**. This is a penalty we add to our overall loss function to stop the transformer from diverging too much from its initial distribution. We want to make our transformer maximize reward, but not in a way which causes it to become completely incoherent!\n","\n","Note that we compute $D_{KL}(\\pi_{PPO} || \\pi_{base})$, not the other way around. This is because we want to penalize our new model for generating outputs which would be **extremely unlikely under the old model**, i.e. when $\\pi_{PPO}$ is high and $\\pi_{base}$ is low. We generally want to focus our model's output into a more concentrated version of the distribution it already has. For example in RLHF, we want to keep a low probability on completely incoherent behaviour which the original model would never have generated. But on the other hand, it's clearly fine for there to be some behaviours (e.g. offensive hate speech) which have a nontrivial probability in our base model but near-zero probability in our new model - in fact this is often desireable!

We want to make sure that the original (probably coherent and sensible) model $Q$ is still a good approximation for how $P$ behaves, i.e. it shouldn't be too obvious when we observe the outputs of $P$ that they've been generated by a different model. -->"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Summary\n"," \n","Since we're using a fixed reward function rather than training it from human feedback, our RLHF implementation looks very similar to yesterday's PPO implementation.

A value head is basically just a simple classifier model which we stick to one of the policy network's internal activations. You can think of this as a kind of feature extraction.

This works for TransformerLens slightly differently than for HuggingFace models (TransformerLens isn't primarily designed for text generation). In particular, it doesn't have features to efficiently generate multiple outputs for a single completion by using key-value caching. So rather than passing an argument into `generate` telling the model to generate `batch_size` outputs, we've instead just repeated `input_ids` multiple times across the batch dimension. This is a bit wasteful since we're repeating computation on the input sequence, but it's not a big problem because the input sequences we'll be using are usually very short.\n","    - As a bonus exercise later, we've suggested you write a version of the `generate` method which uses TransformerLens' key value caching (since TL does support caching behaviour, it just doesn't have features to use caching in `generate` to produce multiple sequences from a single completion).\n","- We've used `stop_at_eos=False`, to make sure that the model generates the full `gen_length` tokens rather than stopping early."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":64,"metadata":{"id":"dZLOfaLUqGhR"},"outputs":[],"source":["@t.no_grad()\n","def get_samples(\n","    base_model: HookedTransformer,\n","    prompt: str,\n","    batch_size: int,\n","    gen_len: int,\n","    temperature: float,\n","    top_k: int,\n","    prepend_bos: bool,\n",") -> tuple[Int[Tensor, \"batch seq\"], list[str]]:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Generates samples from the model, which will be fed into the reward model and evaluated.\n","\n","    Inputs:\n","        gpt: the transformer to generate samples from (note we use gpt, not the model wrapper, cause we don't need value head)\n","        prompt: the initial prompt fed into the model\n","        batch_size: the number of samples to generate\n","        gen_len: the length of the generated samples (i.e. the number of *new* tokens to generate)\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        sample_ids: the token ids of the generated samples (including initial prompt)\n","        samples: the generated samples (including initial prompt)\n","    \"\"\"\n","    #

For example, you might want to start with one of the following:\n","\n","- [`lvwerra/distilbert-imdb`](https://huggingface.co/lvwerra/distilbert-imdb), which was trained to classify IMDB film reviews as positive or negative.\n","- [`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment), which is a model trained on tweets and finetuned for sentiment analysis (categories are positive, neutral and negative).\n","- [`distilbert-base-uncased-emotion`](bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion), which was finetuned on the [Emotion Dataset for Emotion Recognition Tasks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/emotion-dataset), i.e. it's trained to classify text according to emotional tone (classes are sadness, joy, love, anger, fear and surprise).\n","\n","Note that for some of these, you should be using a prompt string which is appropriate for the reward function you're fine-tuning on, e.g. `\"This movie was really\"` for the IMDB model. Similarly, you might also want to change other parameters e.g. generation length. You can find a list of other models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=text-classification).\n","\n","Also, note that for the purposes of doing RLHF, it's fine to use the probability of the positive/negative class as your reward signal. Although this wouldn't provide as much a signal if all our generated sequences were scoring highly, remember that we normalize our rewards before using them to compute our advantages, meaning we can still distinguish between better and worse sequences even if they're all high-scoring.\n","\n","<!-- For reference, you can see the parameters & results of a positive-sentiment IMDB run [here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/callum-mcdougall/3a1bl3y4), and a negative-sentiment run [here](https://api.wandb.ai/links/callum-mcdougall/misa79ct).

Can you go even larger, e.g. `gpt2-xl` or more?\n","\n","See [this page](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/model_properties_table.html) for a table of model properties, for all models currently supported by TransformerLens. Note that if you use different model classes then you might need to change some parts of your code (e.g. if the name of the hook point where you added the value head happens to be different). You might also need to make other adjustments e.g. a smaller batch size (or a larger number of minibatches per batch, which is equivalent to smaller minibatch sizes).\n","\n","### Differential Learning Rates / Frozen Layers\n","\n","When doing any kind of finetuning, it's common practice to either freeze earlier layers or have a smaller learning rate for them. You may have seen this in the feature extraction with ResNet34 exercises in the first week. In the exercises here we've trained all layers of the model equally, but you might want to play around with differential learning rates.\n","\n","Note that you can accomplish this using parameter groups - we already used parameter groups above to have a different learning rate for our base model and value head. It should be relatively straightforward to extend this to splitting parameters over different layers into different groups (hint - you can use `itertools.chain` to convert several iterables into a single iterable).\n","\n","You can also try entirely freezing earlier layers - this might also reduce your memory usage, and allow you to train larger models without getting cuda errors.\n","\n","### Hyperparameter sweeps\n","\n","You can do this to find the best possible hyperparamters for your RLHF training. Don't just measure on reward, can you use some combination of reward and avg kl diff to create a better metric? Can you use wandb's built-in [Bayesian search methods](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/sweep-config-keys#bayesian-search) to more effectively sweep?\n","\n","Note - don't forget **temperature** when it comes to hyperparameter tuning. Temperature has an important effect on how the model learns, e.g. if the temperature is too high then the model will produce very high-variance outputs which will have very high KL with the reference distribution, and it'll be more likely to collapse into some incoherent mode.\n","\n","### Adaptive KL penalty\n","\n","The KL divergence penalty coefficient can be modified adaptively based on the KL divergence between the current policy and the previous policy. If the KL divergence is outside a predefined target range, we can adjust the penalty coefficient to bring it closer to the target range. Here is an example implementation:\n","\n","```python\n","class AdaptiveKLController:\n","    def __init__(self, init_kl_coef, hparams):\n","        self.value = init_kl_coef\n","        self.hparams = hparams\n","\n","    def update(self, current, n_steps):\n","        target = self.hparams.target\n","        proportional_error = np.clip(current / target - 1, -0.2, 0.2)\n","        mult = 1 + proportional_error * n_steps / self.hparams.horizon\n","        self.value *= mult\n","```\n","\n","### TRL / trlX\n","\n","We've been focusing on building RLHF from the ground up, but there are several libraries which exist to abstract away manuy of the low-level implementation details we had to wrestle with. One of the best-known is TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning). The main docs page can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), and [this page](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/quickstart) gives a quickstart guide. You may find it much easier to use this library than to implement everything yourself!\n","\n","Read their documentation pages, and see what techniques they use to make RLHF more effective. Are there any that we haven't implemented here? Can you implement them yourself?\n","\n","You might also be interested in trlX, an expanded fork of TRL built by CarperAI to handle larger models for online and offline training (although their APIs are pretty similar).\n","\n","### Learn a human preference reward model\n","\n","We've been working with a pre-supplied reward function, but you can try and train your own!\n","\n","We'll give some brief points of guidance here, for the task of training a reward function on the **summarization task**. Note that these instructions have been provided externally, so they've not yet been tested and might not work particularly well.\n","\n","1. Get a supervised baseline\n","    * [Here](https://zenodo.org/records/1168855) is a link to download the dataset for the TL;DR challenge containing posts from the Reddit corpus. Each post contains keys `content` and `summary` which are the original post and the human-written summary respectively.\n","    * You should throw out all summaries shorter than 24 tokens or longer than 48 tokens (to diminish the effects of length on quality); and choose a random subset of ~100k summaries to train on.\n","    * Run training to maximize the log-likelihood of these summaries.\n","2. Get reward model by training supervised baseline on human feedback\n","    * Download comparison data with the code `azcopy copy \"https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/summarize-from-feedback/dataset/*\" . --recursive`\n","    * Modify GPT-2 architecture by adding a randomly-initialized **reward head** at the end of your model.\n","        * Architecturally this is similar to the value head from earlier, but it's not the same thing - here we're trying to learn what the human reward will be; we're not doing RL yet.\n","    * Train your model (starting with base model given by supervised baseline weights, and reward head randomly initialized) to minimize `loss = log(sigmoid(reward_model(summary_0) - reward_model(summary_1)))`, `summary_0` is preferred by a human labeler (this data should be in the comparison data you downloaded).\n","    * You should normalize reward model outputs, like we normalized rewards in RLHF in previous exercises.\n","3. Fine-tune supervised baseline using PPO with reward model.\n","    * For these exercises we suggest using a larger model, ideally GPT2-Large or bigger. Remember you can freeze weights! Regardless, this will still take longer to train than your previous models.\n","\n","### Interp on RLHF'd models\n","\n","Currently, very little mechanistic interpretability research ahs focused on RLHF'd models. In [this blog post](https://blog.eleuther.ai/trlx-exploratory-analysis/), Curt Tigges walks through an example of how we can use mech interp to analyze a model which has been finetuned with a sentiment based reward function using trlX.\n","\n","The flavour of the actual mech interp done here is very similar to the indirect object identification exercises you might have done during the transformers & interp week. If you didn't do these exercises, we recommend you do them before diving deep into this material.\n","\n","Lastly, here's a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eUdvlJNqY9X0NAw9UUseZz6dFyRklCcOHQy8x3CbcBk/edit?usp=sharing) brainstorming some ideas for RLHF interpretability.

So, how do we do this?\n","\n","The answer is that we can use the **chain rule**. If we have $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{x_b}}$ (where $\\mathbf{x_b}$ refers to the broadcasted version of $\\mathbf{x}$), then we can calculate the elements of $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}$ by:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} &= \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{x_b}} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x_b}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\\\\n","&= \\sum_{i_1, i_2, ...} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_b[i_1, i_2, ...]} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial x_b[i_1, i_2, ...]}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","\n","<!-- where the sum in this expression is over all indices of $x_b$, so $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_b[i_1, i_2, ...]}$ is a scalar and $\\frac{\\partial x_b[i_1, i_2, ...]}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}$ is a tensor with the same shape as $x$. -->\n","\n","Key claim - **this expression is equivalent to taking $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{x_b}}$ and summing it over the dimensions along which $x$ was broadcasted**.\n","\n","Mathematically, the proof of this is fairly simple: $\\frac{\\partial x_b[i_1, i_2, ...]}{\\partial x[j_1, j_2, ...]} = 1$ when $x_b[i_1, i_2, ...]$ is one of the copies of $x[j_1, j_2, ...]$ that were created during broadcasting, and $0$ otherwise. So summing over the indices $i_1, i_2, ...$ is equivalent to summing over all the elements of $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{x_b}}$ which came from the same element of $x$.\n","\n","More intuitively, let's think about what's going on when we broadcast. Copying some tensor $x$ along axes before performing operations to it, we're effectively giving each element of $x$ more pathways to affect the final derivative. To go back to our example `out = x + y` with `x.shape = (4,)` and `y.shape = (3, 4)`, suppose we then had the scalar `L = out[0, 0] + out[1, 1] + out[2, 1]`. We can rewrite the x-sums as `x_b[0, 0] + x_b[1, 1] + x_b[2, 1] = x[0] + x[1] + x[1] = x[0] + 2x[1]`. So the fact that we copied `x` along the zeroth dimension when broadcasting it with `y` means that some elements of `x` were used multiple times in `L`. In order to get the derivative `dL/dx = [1,2,0,0]`, we start with the matrix of values `dL/dx_b = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0]]` and sum these values over the dimension `x` was broadcasted along.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/broadcast-last.png\" width=\"700\">\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-RfxUf5WEgwj"},"source":["> ##### Summary\n",">\n","> If we know $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial (\\mathbf{out})}$, and want to know $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}$ (where $x$ was broadcasted to produce $\\text{out}$) then there are two steps:\n",">\n","> 1.

This is because a broadcast operation effectively copies our tensor, giving it more gradient paths that we need to sum over. Similarly, the backwards operation for summing is broadcasting. We can intuitively see this as follows: if we have some value `L = L(x_summed)` where `x_summed` is the result of summing `x` over some number of dimensions, then editing `x_summed[i, j, ...] += delta` has the same downstream effect as editing any one of the `x` values which were summed over to get `x_summed[i, j, ...]`.

Remember to deal with the case where `dim=None` (which means we summed over all dimensions).\n","2. **Broadcasting along dims that were summed over**. Since after step (1) you've effectively reduced to the `keepdim=True` case, you can now use `np.broadcast_to` to get the correct shape.\n","\n","Note, if you get weird errors that you can't explain, and these exceptions don't even go away when you use the solutions provided, this could mean that your implementation of `wrap_forward_fn` was wrong in a way which wasn't picked up by the tests.

We'll explain it a bit below (if you're already experienced in Python then this might be obvious to you and you can skip it).\n","\n","#### Single-underscore attributes\n","\n","We've defined `_modules` (a dict mapping module names to module objects), and a `modules` method which returns an iterator over modules. We've done something similar for `self._parameters`, with added logic for **recursion** (i.e. returning the parameters of submodules as well as the parameters specifically from this module).

In general double underscored methods are given special treatment in Python. You can see below that the call method just calls the `forward` method, which is why we only need to fill in the `forward` method for all modules we create.\n","\n","#### Double-underscore attributes: `__setattr__` and `__getattr__`\n","\n","The `__setattr__` and `__getattr__` methods are also special. `__setattr__` method determines how your class instance behaves when you set things like `my_module.attr = value`, and `__getattr__` determines behaviour when you try to access attributes like `my_module.attr`. In this case, the behaviour is just like regular setting & getting, with one exception - modules and parameters have to be explicitly added to `self._modules` and `self._parameters`. This logic is necessary if we want e.g. `my_module.parameters()` to return all our modules' parameters when we pass it into our optimizer, because otherwise we wouldn't know which of our attributes are parameters and which aren't.\n","\n","Note - `__getattr__` is only called as a backup, if the standard lookup method of searching in `self.__dict__` fails (`__dict__` is an automatically populated dict of the object's attributes).

It's effectively just a wrapper for the `relu` function, and you could replace `self.relu` with applying the `relu` function directly without changing the model's behaviour.\n","\n","This is slightly different if we're thinking about adding **hooks** to our model. Hooks are functions that are called during the forward or backward pass, and they can be used to inspect the state of the model during training. We generally want each hook to be associated with a single position in the model, rather than being called at two different points.\n","</details>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CIKjArprZ5Gd"},"source":["### Convolutional layers\n","\n","Now that you've implemented a linear layer, it should be relatively straightforward to take your convolutions code from day 2 and use it to make a convolutional layer.

They trained a model (Othello-GPT) to play legal moves in the board game Othello, by giving it random games (generated by choosing a legal next move uniformly at random) and training it to predict the next move. The headline result is that Othello-GPT learns an emergent world representation - despite never being explicitly given the state of the board, and just being tasked to predict the next move, it learns to compute the state of the board at each move. (Note that the point of Othello-GPT is to play legal moves, not good moves, though they also study a model trained to play good moves.)\n","\n","They present two main pieces of evidence. They can extract the board state from the model's residual stream via non-linear probes (a two layer ReLU MLP). And they can use the probes to causally intervene and change the model's representation of the board (by using gradient descent to have the probes output the new board state) - the model now makes legal moves in the new board state even if they are not legal in the old board, and even if that board state is impossible to reach by legal play!\n","\n","I've strengthened their headline result by finding that much of their more sophisticated (and thus potentially misleading) techniques can be significantly simplified. Not only does the model learn an emergent world representation, it learns a linear emergent world representation, which can be causally intervened on in a linear way! But rather than representing \"this square has a black/white piece\", it represents \"this square has my/their piece\". The model plays both black and white moves, so this is far more natural from its perspective. With this insight, the whole picture clarifies significantly, and the model becomes far more interpretable!\n","\n","### The research process\n","\n","You can read more about the research process in [this post here](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/nhGNHyJHbrofpPbRG/p/TAz44Lb9n9yf52pv8), which I'd strongly recommend.

A pretty hot question right now is whether LLMs are just bundles of statistical correlations or have some real understanding and computation! This gives suggestive evidence that simple objectives to predict the next token can create rich emergent structure (at least in the toy setting of Othello). Rather than just learning surface level statistics about the distribution of moves, it learned to model the underlying process that generated that data. In my opinion, it's already pretty obvious that transformers can do something more than statistical correlations and pattern matching, see eg [induction heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html), but it's great to have clearer evidence of fully-fledged world models!\n","\n","For context on my investigation, it's worth analysing exactly the two pieces of evidence they had for the emergent world representation, the probes and the causal interventions, and their strengths and weaknesses.\n","\n","### Probes\n","\n","The probes give suggestive, but far from conclusive evidence. When training a probe to extract some feature from a model, it's easy to trick yourself. It's crucial to track whether the probe is just reading out the feature, or actually computing the feature itself, and reading out much simpler features from the model. In the extreme case, you could attach a much more powerful model as your \"probe\", and have it just extract the input moves, and then compute the board state from scratch! They found that linear probes did not work to recover board state (with an error rate of 20.4%): (ie, projecting the residual stream onto some 3 learned directions for each square, corresponding to empty, black and white logits). While the simplest non-linear probes (a two layer MLP with a single hidden ReLU layer) worked extremely well (an error rate of 1.7%). Further (as described in their table 2, screenshot below), these non-linear probes did not work on a randomly initialised network, and worked better on some layers than others, suggesting they were learning something real from the model.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nmxzr2zsjNtjaHh7x/b5rxfns1wxvsuomh1d79\" width=\"550\">\n","\n","### Causal interventions\n","\n","Probes on their own can mislead, and don't necessarily tell us that the model uses this representation - the probe could be extracting some vestigial features or a side effect of some more useful computation, and give a misleading picture of how the model computes the solution. But their causal interventions make this much more compelling evidence. They intervene by a fairly convoluted process (detailed in the figure below, though you don't need to understand the details), which boils down to choosing a new board state, and applying gradient descend to the model's residual stream such that our probe thinks the model's residual stream represents the new board state. I have an immediate skepticism of any complex technique like this: when applying a powerful method like gradient descent it's so easy to wildly diverge from what the models original functioning is like! But the fact that the model could do the non-trivial computation of converting an edited board state into a legal move post-edit is a very impressive result! I consider it very strong evidence both that the probe has discovered something real, and that the representation found by the probe is causally linked to the model's actual computation!\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VtsbnSYxHjVQ"},"source":["## Naive Implications for Mechanistic Interpretability\n","\n","I was very interested in this paper, because it simultaneously had the fascinating finding of an emergent world model (and I'm also generally into any good interp paper), yet something felt off. The techniques used here seemed \"too\" powerful. The results were strong enough that something here seemed clearly real, but my intuition is that if you've really understood a model's internals, you should just be able to understand and manipulate it with far simpler techniques, like linear probes and interventions, and it's easy to be misled by more powerful techniques.\n","\n","In particular, my best guess about model internals is that the networks form [**decomposable, linear representations**](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=KiDMIteKCEXt_EkR2sZCOfbG): that the model computes a bunch of useful features, and represents these as directions in activation space. See [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#motivation) for some excellent exposition on this. This is decomposable because each feature can vary independently (from the perspective of the model - on the data distribution they're likely dependent), and linear because we can extract a feature by projecting onto that feature's direction (if the features are orthogonal - if we have something like [superposition](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=3br1psLRIjQCOv2T4RN3V6F2) it's messier). This is a natural way for models to work - they're fundamentally a series of matrix multiplications with some non-linearities stuck in convenient places, and a decomposable, linear representation allows it to extract any combination of features with a linear map!\n","\n","Under this framework, if a feature can be found by a linear probe then the model has already computed it, and if that feature is used in a circuit downstream, we should be able to causally intervene with a linear intervention, just changing the coordinate along that feature's direction. So the fascinating finding that linear probes do not work, but non-linear probes do, suggests that either the model has a fundamentally non-linear representation of features (which it is capable of using directly for downstream computation!), or there's a linear representation of simpler and more natural features, from which the probe computes board state. My prior was on a linear representation of simpler features, but the causal intervention findings felt like moderate evidence for the non-linear representation. And the non-linear representation hypothesis would be a big deal if true! If you want to reverse-engineer a model, you need to have a crisp picture of how its computation maps onto activations and weights, and this would break a lot of my beliefs about how this correspondance works! Further, linear representations are just really *convenient* to reverse-engineer, and this would make me notably more pessimistic about mechanistic interpretability working.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"56Nf7HKWHjVQ"},"source":["## Model Setup & Visualization"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a_JwiI8UHjVQ"},"source":["The best way to become less confused about a mysterious model behaviour is to mechanistically analyse it. To zoom in on whatever features and circuits we can find, build our understanding from the bottom up, and use this to form grounded beliefs about what's actually going on.\n","\n","To get started, let's load in the model that we'll be using for this chapter. A few important technical details:\n","\n","- Othello games have 60 moves (the board has size 8x8, and the middle 4 squares are all occupied, so by 60 moves all squares are occupied by some color). The model's context length is 59, because it's learned to take in `moves[0:59]` and predict `moves[1:60]`. \n","- The dataset the model was trained on just consists of randomly sampled legal moves. A move in Othello is legal if and only if it captures the opponents' pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line - in which case it flips all those pieces to its own color. This means **predicting next legal moves is a nontrivial task (one might guess it requires the mdoel to track captures and board states over time)**\n","    - Because the model was trained on cross entropy loss against the actual next moves, the model's distribution converges to uniform over all next legal moves - can you see why?\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Proof - why the model learns a uniform distribution over next legal moves</summary>\n","\n","The cross entropy loss is defined as $H(p, q) = -\\sum_x p(x) \\log q(x)$, which by [Gibbs' inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs%27_inequality) is minimized when $p(x) = q(x)$. So we minimize loss when the model's distribution $q$ matches the underlying data distribution $p$, which is uniform over next legal moves.\n","\n","Note we can also prove this using Jensen's inequality, since $\\log q(x)$ is a strictly concave function. Alternatively, we can express the cross entropy loss as the sum of the underlying data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the model's distribution and the underlying distribution:\n","\n","$$\n","H(p, q) = -\\sum_x p(x) \\log q(x) = \\sum_x p(x) \\log \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} - \\sum_x p(x) \\log p(x) = D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p \\| q) + H(p)\n","$$\n","\n","so this statement becomes equivalent to the statement that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p \\| q)$ is always non-negative and is only zero when $p(x) = q(x)$ (which can be proved in similar ways).\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","- The vocabulary size is 61, because we allow any of the 8x8 - 4 = 60 unoccupied squares to be played, plus the pass move. The vocab is ordered `pass, A0, A1, ..., H7`. Note that we'll be filtering out games where a `pass` move was played, so we don't need to worry about this.\n","- We'll refer to squares in 3 different ways: \n","    1. **label** - this is the string representation, i.e. `\"pass\"`, `\"A0\"`, `\"A1\"`, ..., `\"H7\"`.\n","    2. **id** - this is the token ID in the model's vocab, i.e. `1` for A0, ..., `60` for H7. We skip `0` which is the token id for `pass`, and we skip the 4 middle squares since they're always occupied and so there are no moves in or predictions for these squares.\n","    3. **int** - this is the zero-indexed value of the square in the size-64 board, i.e. `0` for A0, `1` for A1, ..., `63` for H7.\n","- Black plays first in Othello, and so (in games with no passes) White plays last.

Note that `game_len` is less than `full_game_len=60`, because we're removing the first and last 5 games.\n","\n","* Run the model in inference mode, and get the residual stream (post attn and MLP).\n","    * Note - remember to only use `games_int[:, :-1]` as input, since we don't have a label for the final move.\n","        * Hint - you might want to use the `name_filter` argument of `run_with_cache` so you only get `resid_post`.\n","    * Also, we only want to take the slice `pos_start: pos_end` of the cached values.\n","* Multiply the residual stream values with the linear probe values and sum over the hidden dimension.\n","    * The result should be a tensor of shape `(modes=3, batch, seq_pos, rows=8, cols=8, options=3)`.\n","* Convert this tensor of logits into a tensor of log probabilities (over `options=3`).\n","* Multiply this tensor by `state_stack_one_hot` and sum over the final dimensions (the `options` dimension).\n","    * This is equivalent to indexing along the `options` dimension to choose the log prob corresponding to the correct move (remember that cross entropy loss is negative log prob).\n","* Take the mean over the batch dimension.\n","* Calculate `loss_even`, `loss_odd` and `loss_all`.\n","    * These are the average negative log probs for the correct move, for each of the three modes: even moves, odd moves, and all moves aggregated.\n","    * Make sure you index these correctly (e.g. `loss_even` should be the `mode=0`-th dimension of your linear probe tensor).\n","    * Note - this is because the zeroth mode (\"black to play / odd moves\") are the even moves in the moves vector, if we're indexing from zero.\n","* Return the sum of these three losses.\n","\n","Once you've finished implementing this function, you can run the code below. You'll know it's working if your training loss decreases at a reasonable rate (it should start at around 300, and will probably drop down to somewhere between 30 and 100 by the end of your training

Can working on toy tasks like Othello-GPT really help us to reverse-engineer LLMs like GPT-4? I'm not sure! But I think it's a plausible bet worth making.\n","\n","To walk through my reasoning, it's worth first thinking on what's holding us back - why haven't we already reverse-engineered the most capable models out there? I'd personally point to a few key factors (though note that this is my personal hot take, is not comprehensive, and I'm sure other researchers have their own views!):\n","\n","*   **Conceptual frameworks**: To reverse-engineer a transformer, you need to know how to think like a transformer. Questions like: What kinds of algorithms is it natural for a transformer to represent, and how? Are features and circuits the right way to think about it? Is it even reasonable to expect that reverse-engineering is possible? How can we tell if a hypothesis or technique is principled vs hopelessly confused? What does it even mean to have truly identified a feature or circuit?\n","    *   I personally thought [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) significantly clarified my conceptual frameworks for transformer circuits!\n","    *   This blog post is fundamentally motivated by forming better conceptual frameworks - do models form linear representations?\n","*   **Practical Knowledge/Techniques**: Understanding models is hard, and being able to do this in practice is hard. Getting better at this both looks like forming a better toolkit of techniques that help us form true beliefs about models, and also just having a bunch of practical experience with finding circuits and refining the tools - can we find any cases where they break? How can we best interpret the results?\n","    *   A concrete way this is hard is that models contain many circuits, each of which only activates on certain inputs. To identify a circuit we must first identify where it is and what it does, out of the morass! Activation patching (used in ROME, Interpretability in the Wild and refined with causal scrubbing) is an important innovation here.\n","*   **Understanding MLP Layers**: 2/3 of the parameters in transformers are in MLP layers, which process the information collected at each token position. We're pretty bad understanding them, and getting better at this is vital!\n","    *   We think these layers represent features as directions in space, and if each neuron represents a single feature, we're pretty good! But in practice this seems to be false, because of the poorly understood phenomena of superposition and polysemanticity\n","    *   [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) helped clarify my conceptual frameworks re superposition, but there's still a lot more to de-confuse! And a _lot_ of work to do to form the techniques to deal with it in practice. I'm still not aware of a single satisfying example of really understanding a circuit involving MLPs in a language model\n","*   **Scalability**: LLMs are _big_, and getting bigger all the time. Even if we solve all of the above in eg four layer transformers, this could easily involve some very ad-hoc and labour intensive techniques. Will this transfer to models far larger? And how well do the conceptual frameworks we form transformer - do they just break on models that are much more complex?\n","    *   This often overlaps with forming techniques (eg, causal scrubbing is an automated algorithm with the potential to scale, modulo figuring out many efficiency and implementation details). But broadly I don't see much work on this publicly, and would be excited to see more - in particular, checking how well our conceptual frameworks transfer, and whether all the work on small models is a bit of a waste of time!\n","        *   My personal hot take is that I'm more concerned about never getting _really_ good at interpreting a four layer model, than about scaling _if_ we're really good at four layer models - both because I just feel pretty confused about even small models, and because taking understood yet labour-intensive techniques and making them faster and more automatable seems hard but doable (especially with near-AGI systems!). But this is a complex empirical question and I could easily be wrong.\n","\n","Within this worldview, what should our research goals be? Fundamentally, I'm an empiricist - models are hard and confusing, it's easy to trick yourself, and often intuitions can mislead. The core thing of any research project is getting feedback from reality, and using it to form true beliefs about models. This can either look like forming explicit hypotheses and testing them, or exploring a model and seeing what you stumble upon, but the fundamental question is whether you have the potential to be surprised and to get feedback from reality.\n","\n","This means that any project is a trade-off between tractability and relevance to the end goal. Studying toy, algorithmic models is a double edged sword. They can be very tractable: they're clean and algorithmic which incentivises clean circuits, there's an available ground truth for what the model _should_ be doing, and they're often in a simple and nicely constrained domain. But it's extremely easy for them to cease to be relevant to real LLMs and become a nerd-snipe. (Eg, I personally spent a while working on grokking, and while this was very fun, I think it's just not very relevant to LLMs)\n","\n","It's pretty hard to do research by constantly checking whether you're being nerd-sniped, and to me there are two natural solutions:\n","\n","*   (1) To pick a concrete question you care about in language models, and to set out to specifically answer that, in a toy model that you're confident is a good proxy for that question\n","    *   Eg [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) built a pretty good toy model of residual stream superposition\n","*   (2) To pick a toy model that's a good enough proxy for LLMs _in general_, and just try hard to get as much traction on reverse-engineering that model as you can.\n","    *   Eg [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) - I think that \"train a model exactly like an LLM, but with only 1 or 2 layers\" is pretty good as proxies go, though not perfect.\n","\n","To me, working on Othello-GPT is essentially a bet on (2), that there in gneeral some are underlying principles of transformers and how they learn circuits, and that the way they manifest in Othello-GPT can teach us things about real models. This is definitely wrong in _some_ ways (I don't expect the specific circuits we find to be in GPT-3!), and it's plausible this is wrong in enough ways to be not worth working on, but I think it seems plausible enough to be a worthwhile research direction. My high-level take is just \"I think this is a good enough proxy about LLMs that studying it hard will teach us generally useful things\".\n","\n","There's a bunch of key disanalogies to be careful of! Othello is fundamentally not the same task as language: Othello is a much simpler task, there's only 60 moves, there's a rigid and clearly defined syntax with correct and incorrect answers (not a continuous mess), the relevant info about moves so far can be _fully_ captured by the current board state, and generally many sub-tasks in language will not apply.\n","\n","But it's also surprisingly analogous, at least by the standards of toy models! Most obviously, it's a transformer trained to predict the next token! But the task is also much more complex than eg modular addition, and it has to do it in weird ways! The way I'd code Othello is by doing it recursively - find the board state at move n and use it to get the state at move n+1. But transformers can't do this, they need to do things with a fixed number of serial steps but with a lot of computation in parallel (ie, at every move it must simultaneously compute the board state _at that move_ in parallel) - it's not obvious to me how to do this, and I expect that the way it's encoded will teach me a lot about how to represent certain kinds of algorithms in transformers. And it needs to be solving a bunch of sub-tasks that interact in weird ways (eg, a piece can be taken multiple times in each of four different directions), computing and remembering a lot of information, and generally forming coherent circuits.\n","\n","In the next few sections I'll argue for how finding modular circuits can help build **practical knowledge and techniques**, what we could learn from **understanding its MLPs**, and more broadly how it could act as a laboratory for forming better **conceptual frameworks** (it's clearly not a good way to study scalability lol)\n","\n","### This is not about world models\n","\n","A high-level clarification: Though the focus of the original paper was on understanding how LLMs can form emergent world models, this is _not_ why I am arguing for these research directions. My interpretation of the original paper was that it was strong evidence for the fact that it's _possible_ for \"predict the next token\" models to form world emergent models, despite never having explicit access to the ground truth of the world/board state. I personally was already convinced that this was possible, but think the authors did great work that showed this convincingly and well (and I am even more convinced after my follow-up!), and that there's not much more to say on the \"is this possible\" question.\n","\n","There's many interesting questions about whether these happen _in practice_ in LLMs and what this might look like and how to interpret it - my personal guess is that they do _sometimes_, but are pretty expensive (in terms of parameters and residual stream bandwidth) and only form when it's high value for reducing next token loss and the model is big enough to afford it. Further, there's often much cheaper hacks, eg, BingChat doesn't need to have formed an explicit chess board model to be decent at playing legal moves in chess! Probably not even for reasonably good legal play: the chess board state is _way_ easier than Othello, pieces can't even change colour! And you can get away with an implicit rather than explicit world model that just computes the relevant features from the context, eg to see where to a move a piece from, just look up the most recent point where that piece was played and look at the position it was moved to.\n","\n","But Othello is very disanalogous to language here - playing legal moves in Othello has a single, perfectly sufficient world model that I can easily code up (though not quite in four transformer layers!), and which is incredibly useful for answering the underlying task! Naively, Othello-GPT roughly seems to be spending 128 of its 512 residual stream dimensions of this model, which is very expensive (though it's probably using superposition). So while it's a proof of concept that world models are possible, I don't think the finer details here tell us much about whether these world models actually happen in real LLMs. This seems best studied by actually looking at language models, and [I think there's many exciting questions here](/posts/XNjRwEX9kxbpzWFWd/200-cop-in-mi-looking-for-circuits-in-the-wild)! (eg doing mech interp on [Patel et al's work](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gJcEM8sxHK)) The point of my investigation was more to refine our conceptual frameworks for thinking about models/transformers, and the goal of these proposed directions is to push forward transformer mech interp in general.\n","\n","## Finding Modular Circuits\n","\n","Basically all prior work on circuits (eg, [induction heads](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=_Jzi6YHRHKP1JziwdE02qdYZ), [indirect object identification](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=iWsV3s5Kdd2ca3zNgXr5UPHa), [the docstring circuit](/posts/u6KXXmKFbXfWzoAXn/a-circuit-for-python-docstrings-in-a-4-layer-attention-only), and [modular addition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05217.pdf)) have been on what I call **end-to-end** circuits. We take some model behaviour that maps certain inputs to certain outputs (eg the input of text with repetition, and the output of logits correctly predicting the repetition), and analyse the circuit going from the inputs to the outputs.\n","\n","This makes sense as a place to start! The inputs and outputs are inherently interpretable, and the most obvious thing to care about. But it stands in contrast to much of the image circuits work, that identified neurons representing interpretable features ([like curves](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/curve-circuits)) and studied how they were computed and how these were used to computed more sophisticated features (like [car wheels -> cars](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in)). Let's consider the analogy of mech interp to reverse-engineering a compiled program binary to source code. End-to-end circuits are like thinking of the source code as a single massive block of code, and identifying which sections we can ignore.\n","\n","But a natural thing to aim for is to find **variables**, corresponding to interpretable activations within the network that correspond to **features**, some property of the input. The linear representation hypothesis says that these should be directions in activation space. It's not guaranteed that LLMs _are_ modular in the sense of forming interpretable intermediate features, but this seems implied by exiasting work, eg in the residual stream (often studied with probes), or in the MLP layers ([possibly as interpretable neurons](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html#section-6-3)). If we _can_ find interpretable variables, then the reverse-engineering task becomes much easier - we can now separately analyse the circuits that form the feature(s) from the inputs or earlier features, and the circuits that use the feature(s) to compute the output logits or more complex feature.\n","\n","I call a circuit which starts or ends at some intermediate activation a **modular circuit** (in contrast to end-to-end circuits). These will likely differ in two key ways from end-to-end circuits:\n","\n","*   They will likely be **shallower**, ie involving fewer layers of composition, because they're not end-to-end. Ideally we'd be able to eg analyse a single neuron or head in isolation.\n","    *   And hopefully easier to find!\n","*   They will be **composable** - rather than needing to understand a full end-to-end circuit, we can understand different modular circuits in isolation, and need only understand the input and output features of each circuit, not the circuits that computed them.\n","    *   Hopefully this also makes it easier to predict model behaviour off distribution, by analysing how interpretable units may compose in unexpected ways!\n","\n","I think this is just obviously a thing we're going to need to get good at to have a shot at real frontier models! Modular circuits mean that we can both re-use our work from finding circuits before, and hopefully have many fewer levels of composition. But they introduce a new challenge - how do we find exactly what direction corresponds to the feature output by the first circuit, ie the **interface** between the two circuits? I see two natural ways of doing this:\n","\n","*   Exploiting a privileged basis - finding interpretable neurons or attention patterns (if this can be thought of as a feature?) and using these as our interpretable foothold.\n","    *   This is great if it works, but superposition means this likely won't be enough.\n","*   Using probes to find an interpretable foothold in the residual stream or other activations - rather than assuming there's a basis direction, we learn the correct direction\n","    *   This seems the only kind of approach that's robust to superposition, and there's [a lot of existing academic work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12452) to build upon!\n","    *   But this introduces new challenges - rather than analysing discrete units, it's now crucial to find the _right_ direction and easy to have errors. It seems hard to produce composable circuits if we can't find the right interface.\n","\n","So what does any of this have to do with Othello-GPT? I think we'll learn a lot by practicing finding modular circuits in Othello-GPT. Othello-GPT has a world model - clear evidence of spontaneous modularity - and our linear probe tells us where it is in the residual stream. And this can be intervened upon - so we know there are downstream circuits that use it. This makes it a great case study! By about layer 4, of the 512 dimensions of the residual stream, we have 64 directions corresponding to which cell has \"my colour\" and 60 directions corresponding to which cells are blank (the 4 center cells are never blank). This means we can get significant traction on what _any_ circuit is reading or writing from the residual stream.\n","\n","This is an attempt to get at the \"**practical knowledge/techniques**\" part of [my breakdown of mech interp bottlenecks](/posts/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/othello-gpt-future-work-i-am-excited-about#Why_and_when_to_work_on_toy_models) - Othello-GPT is a highly imperfect model of LLMs, but I expect finding modular circuits here to be highly tractable and to tell us a lot. Othello-GPT cares a lot about the world model - the input format of a sequence of moves is hard and messy to understand, while \"is this move legal\" can be answered purely from the board state. So the model will likely devote significant resources to computing board state, forming fairly clean circuits. Yet I still don't fully know how to do it, and I expect it to be hard enough to expose a bunch of the underlying practical and conceptual issues and to teach us useful things about doing this in LLMs.\n","\n","**Gnarly conceptual issues**:\n","\n","*   How to find the _right_ directions with a probe. Ie the correct interface between world-model-computing circuits and world-model-using circuits, such that we can think of the two independently. I see two main issues:\n","    *   Finding _all_ of the right direction - a probe with cosine sim of 0.7 to the \"true\" direction might work totally fine\n","        *   In particular, can we stop the probe from picking up on features that are constant in this context? Eg \"is cell B6 my colour\" is only relevant if \"is cell B6 blank\" is False, so there's naively no reason for the probe to be orthogonal to it.\n","    *   Ignoring features that correlate but are not causally linked - the corner cell can only be non-blank if at least one of the three neighbouring cells are, so the \"is corner blank\" direction _should_ overlap with these.\n","        *   But my intuition is that the model is learning a _causal_ world model, not correlational - if you want to do complex computations it's useful to explicitly distinguish between \"is corner blank\" as a thing to compute and use downstream, and all the other features. Rather than picking up on statistical correlations in the data.\n","*   If we find interpretable directions in the residual stream that are not orthogonal, how do we distinguish between \"the model genuinely wants them to overlap\" vs \"this is just interference from superposition\"?\n","    *   Eg, the model should want \"is cell A4 blank\" to have positive cosine sim with the unembed for the \"A4 is legal\" logit - non-blank cells are never legal!\n","*   The world model doesn't seem to be fully computed by layer X and only used in layer X+1 onwards - you sometimes need to intervene before layer 4, and sometimes the calculation hasn't finished before layer 5. How can we deal with overlapping layers? Is there a clean switchover layer _per cell_ that we can calculate separately?\n","*   How can we distinguish between two features having non-zero dot product because of noise/superposition, vs because they are correlated and the model is using one to compute the other.\n","\n","**Questions I want answered**:\n","\n","*   How _can_ we find the true probe directions, in a robust and principled way? Ideas:\n","    *   Use high weight decay to get rid of irrelevant directions. SGD (maybe with momentum) may be cleaner than AdamW here\n","    *   Use more complex techniques than logistic regression, like [amnesiac probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00995) (I found [Eleuther's Tuned Lens](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08112.pdf) paper a useful review)\n","    *   Find the directions that work best for causal interventions instead.\n","    *   Maybe use the janky probe directions to try to find the heads and neurons that compute the world model, and use the fact that these are a privileged-ish basis to refine our understanding of the probe directions - if they never contribute to some component of the probe, probably that component shouldn't be there!\n","    *   Maybe implicitly assume that the probe directions should form an orthogonal set\n","    *   Maybe train a probe, then train a second probe on the residual stream component orthogonal to the first probe. Keep going until your accuracy sucks, and then take some kind of weighted average of the residual stream.\n","*   How is the blank world model computed?\n","    *   This _should_ be really easy - a cell is blank iff it has never been played, so you can just have an attention head that looks at previous moves. Maybe it's done after the layer 0 attention!\n","    *   This is trivial with an attention head per cell, but probably the model wants to be more efficient. What does this look like?\n","        *   Eg it might have a single attention head look at _all_ previous moves with uniform attention.

The meta-level point that makes me excited about this is that linear probes are _really_ nice objects for interpretability. Fundamentally, transformers are made of linear algebra! Every component (layer, head and neuron) reads its input from the residual stream with a linear map, and writes it output by adding it to the residual stream, which is a _really_ nice structure.\n","\n","**Probing across layers**: One way this is nice is that we can immediately get a foothold into understanding how the world model is computed. The residual stream is the sum of the embeddings and the output of every previous head and neuron. So when we apply a linear map like our probe, we can also break this down into a direct contribution from each previous head and neuron.\n","\n","This is the same key idea as direct logit attribution, but now our projection is onto a probe direction rather than the unembed direction for a specific next token. This means we can immediately zoom in to the step of the circuit immediately before the probe, and see which components matter for each cell!\n","\n","As an example, let's look at move 20 in this game:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/heamef6n9xzedn5lkd1a\" width=\"300\">\n","\n","The probe can perfectly predict the board state by layer 4\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/cozpptrltfdnolvyjvfo\" width=\"500\">\n","\n","We can now look at how much the output of each attention and each MLP layer contributed to this (concretely we take the output of each attention and each MLP layer on move 30, and project them onto the is\\_blank direction and the is\\_mine direction for each cell, and plot this as a heatmap - [check the accompanying notebook for details](https://neelnanda.io/othello-notebook)). The MLP layer contributions to whether a cell has my or their colour is particularly interesting - we can see that it normally does nothing, but has a strong effect on the central stripe of cells that were just taken by the opponent - plausibly MLPs calculate when a cell is taken, and attention aggregates this? I'd love to see if there are specific neurons involve.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/tqfl3q5mzwcbycxpcfi5\" width=\"700\">\n","\n","**Reading Off Neuron Weights**: Another great thing about a linear probe is that it gives us a meaningful set of directions and subspace in the residual stream (beyond that given by the embedding and unembedding).

These represent over 2/3 of the parameters in models, but we've had much more traction understanding attention-focused circuits. I'm not aware of a single public example of what I'd consider a well-understood circuit involving transformer MLP layers (beyond possibly my work on modular addition in a one layer transformer, but that's cheating). There are tantalising hints about the circuits they're used in in eg [SoLU](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html) and [ROME](https://rome.baulab.info/), but I broadly still feel confused re what is mechanistically going on.

A lot of our intuitions about transformer neurons come from image models, where neurons seem to (mostly?) represent features, have ReLU activations, and seem to be doing fairly discrete kinds of logic, eg \"if car wheel present and car body present and car window present (in the right places) -> it's a car\".\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/ze4jai5ioub31ovgewdj\" width=\"800\">\n","\n","Transformers are different in a bunch of ways - there's attention layers, there's a residual stream (with significantly smaller dimension than the number of neurons in each layer!), and smoother and weirder GELU activations. Most importantly, polysemanticity seem to be a much bigger deal - single neurons often represent multiple features rather than a feature per neuron - and we think this is because models are using superposition - they represent features as linear combinations of neurons and use this to compress in more features than they have dimensions. This was argued for pretty convincingly in [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html), but their insights were derived from a toy model, which can easily be misleading.

My high-level take is that a solid strategy is just going out, looking for interesting neurons, and trying to understand them deeply - no grander purpose or high-level questions about the model needed. I'd start with similar goals as I gave in [the previous section](/posts/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/othello-gpt-future-work-i-am-excited-about#Finding_Modular_Circuits) - look for the neurons that are used to compute the probe, and directly used by the probe.

Empirical data here seems really valuable! Though there are some important ways that the setup of Othello-GPT differs from their toy model. Notably, they study continuous (uniform \\[0, 1\\]) features, while Othello-GPT's features seem likely to be binary (on or off), as they're discrete and logical functions of the board state and of the previous moves. Binary features seem more representative of language, especially early token-level features like bigrams and multi-token words, and are also easier to put into superposition, because you don't need to distinguish low values of the correct feature from high values of the incorrect feature\n","\n","A broader point is whether we expect Othello-GPT to use superposition at all? Their model has more features to represent than dimensions, and so _needs_ to use superposition to pack things in. It's not obvious to me how many features Othello-GPT wants to represent, and how this compares to the number of dimensions - my _guess_ is that it still needs to use superposition, but it's not clear. Some considerations:\n","\n","*   There's actually a lot of very specific features it might want to learn - eg in the board state -> output logit parts there seems to be a neuron representing C0==BLANK & D1==THEIR'S & E2==MINE, ie can I place a counter in C0 such that it flanks exactly one counter on the diagonal line to the down and right - if this kind of thing is useful, it suggests the model is dealing with a large combinatorial explosion of cases for the many, many similar configurations!\n","    *   Further, computing the board state from the moves also involves a lot of messy cases, eg dealing with the many times and directions a piece can be flipped and combining this all into a coherent story.\n","        *   Reminder: Transformers are not recurrent - it can't compute the board state at move n from the state at move n-1, it needs to compute the state at every move _simultaneously_ with just a few layers of attention to move partial computation forwards. This is actually really hard, and it's not obvious to me how you'd implement this in a transformer!\n","*   There are two different kinds of superposition, residual stream superposition and neuron superposition (ie having more features than dimensions in the residual stream vs in the MLP hidden layer).\n","    *   The residual stream has 512 dimensions, but there's 8 layers of 2048 neurons each (plus attention heads) - unless many neurons do nothing or are highly redundant, it seems very likely that there's residual stream superposition!\n","        *   Though note that it's plausible it just has way fewer than 2048 features worth computing, and is massively over-parametrised. I'm not sure what to think here!\n","        *   The board state alone consumes 25% of the dimensions, if each feature gets a dedicated dimension, and I expect there's probably a bunch of other features worth computing and keeping around?\n","\n","Concrete questions I'd want to test here - note that the use of dropout may obfuscate these questions (by incentivising redundancy and backup circuits), and this may be best answered in a model without dropout. These also may be best answered in a smaller model with fewer layers and a narrower residual stream, and so with a stronger incentive for superposition!:\n","\n","*   Do important features get dedicated dimensions in the residual stream? (ie, orthogonal to all other features)\n","    *   Guesses for important features - whether black or white is playing, the board state, especially features which say which center cells have my colour vs their's.\n","*   Conversely, can we find evidence that there _is_ overlap between features in the residual stream?\n","    *   This is surprisingly thorny, since you need to distinguish this kind of genuine interference vs intentional overlapping, eg from the source of the first feature actually wanting to contribute a bit to feature two as well.\n","*   Do the important neurons seem monosemantic?\n","    *   Important could mean many things eg high effect when patching, high average activation or standard deviation of activation, high cost when ablated, or any other range of measurements, high gradient or gradient x activation\n","    *   My workflow would be to use the probe and unembed to interpret neuron weights, max activating dataset examples to help form a hypothesis, and then use a spectrum plot to properly analyse it (discussed more below).\n","*   Do we get seemingly unrelated features sharing a neuron? The paper predicts superposition is more likely when there are two uncorrelated or anti-correlated features, because then the model doesn't need to track the simultaneous interference of _both_ being there at once.\n","*   Can we find examples of a feature being computed that _needs_ more than one neuron? Analogous to how eg [modular addition uses ReLUs to multiply two numbers together](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05217.pdf), which takes at least three to do properly.

This is actually a fair bit harder to interpret than language, since \"what are the connections between these sequences of moves\" isn't obvious. I got the most traction from studying board state - in particular, the average number of times each cell is non-empty, and the average number of times a cell is mine vs their's. Here's a plot of the latter for neuron L5N1393 that seems immediately interpretable - D1 is always their's, E2 is always mine!

But this seems inconsistent with the direct logit attribution of the neuron (ie the output vector of the neuron projected by the unembed onto the output logits), which seems to boost C0 a lot but also D1 a bit - which seems wildly inconsistent with it firing on D1 being their colour (and thus not a legal place to play!)\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/fsa4iovike7xuoz6tirm\" width=\"500\">\n","\n","These techniques can all be misleading - max activating dataset examples [can cause interpretability illusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07143), direct logit attribution can fail for neurons that mostly indirectly affect logits, and probes can fail to interpret neurons that mostly read out unrelated features. One of the more robust tools for checking what a neuron means is a **spectrum plot** - if we think a neuron represents some feature, we plot a histogram of the \"full spectrum\" of the neuron's activations by just taking the neuron activation on a ton of data, and plotting a histogram grouped by whether the feature is present or not (used in [curve detectors](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/curve-detectors) and [multimodal neurons](https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/)).

Plausibly it's still monosemantic but there's some extra detail I'm missing, I'm not sure! My next steps would be to refine the hypothesis by inspecting the most positive and most negative True examples, and if I can get a cleaner histogram to then try some causal interventions (eg mean ablating the neuron and seeing if it has the effect my hypothesis would predict).

One reason I'm excited about neuron interpretability in Othello-GPT is that it's really easy to write automated tests for neurons and thus get spectrum plots, and thus to really investigate monosemanticity! If we want to be able to make real and robust claims to have identified circuits involving neurons or to have mechanistically reverse-engineered a neurons, I want to better understand whether we can claim the neuron is genuinely only used for a single purpose (with noise) or is also used more weakly to represent other features. And a concrete prediction of the toy models framework is that there _should_ be some genuinely monosemantic neurons for the most important features.\n","\n","That said, showing genuine monosemanticity is hard and spectrum plots are limited. Spectrum plots will still fall down for superposition with very rare features - these can be falsely dismissed as just noise, or just never occur in the games studied! And it's hard to know where to precisely draw the line for \"is monosemantic\" - it seems unreasonable to say that the smallest True activation must be larger than the largest False one! To me the difference is whether the differences genuinely contribute to the model having low loss, vs on average contributing nothing. I think questions around eg how best to interpret these plots are an example of the kind of practical knowledge I want to get from practicing neuron interpretability!\n","\n","#### Case Study: Neurons and Probes are Confusing\n","\n","As a case study in how this can be confusing, here's an earlier draft graph for the section on finding modular circuits - looking at the output weights of top layer 4 neurons (by std) in the blank probe basis. It initially seems like these are all neurons dedicated to computing that a single cell is blank. And I initially got excited and thought this made a great graph for the post!

So what's up with this?\n","\n","It turns out that what's actually going on is that the blank probe is highly correlated with the unembed (the linear map from the final residual to the logits). A cell can be legal _only if_ it is blank, if a cell has a high logit at the end of the model, then it's probably blank. But our probe was computed after layer 6, when there's a lot of extraneous information that probably obscures the blankness information - probably, the probe also learned that if there's going to be a high logit for a cell then that cell is definitely blank, and so the blank directions are partially aligned with the unembed directions. Though on another interpretation, `is_blank` and the unembed are _intentionally_ aligned, because the model knows there's a causal link and so uses the `is_blank` subspace to also contribute to the relevant unembed.\n","\n","And we see that the alignment with the unembed is even higher!

Here's a rough brainstorm of weird hypotheses and confusions about what we might find inside transformers - I expect that sufficient investigation of Othello-GPT will shed light on many of them!\n","\n","Since Othello-GPT is an imperfect proxy for LLMs, it's worth reflecting on what evidence here looks like. I'm most excited about Othello-GPT providing \"existence proofs\" for mysterious phenomena like memory management: case studies of specific phenomena, making it seem more likely that they arise in real language models. Proofs that something was not used/needed are great, but need to be comprehensive enough to overcome the null hypothesis of \"this was/wasn't there but we didn't look hard enough\", which is a high bar!\n","\n","*   Does it do **memory management** in the residual stream?

With a technique similar to the logit lens, they find that the residual structure of Leela Zero induces a preferred basis throughout network, giving rise to persistent, interpretable channels. By directly analyzing the weights of the policy and value heads, they found that the model stores information related to the probability of the pass move along the top edge of the board, and those related to the board value in checkerboard patterns. The authors also took a deep dive into a specific Go technique, the ladder, and identified a very small subset of model components that are causally responsible for the model's judgement of ladders.\n","\n","Adapting interpretability techniques to a model like this might be quite challenging (Leela Zero is a deep CNN, based more on AlphaGo's architecture than on any transformer model).

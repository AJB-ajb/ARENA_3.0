They trained a model (Othello-GPT) to play legal moves in the board game Othello, by giving it random games (generated by choosing a legal next move uniformly at random) and training it to predict the next move. The headline result is that Othello-GPT learns an emergent world representation - despite never being explicitly given the state of the board, and just being tasked to predict the next move, it learns to compute the state of the board at each move. (Note that the point of Othello-GPT is to play legal moves, not good moves, though they also study a model trained to play good moves.)\n","\n","They present two main pieces of evidence. They can extract the board state from the model's residual stream via non-linear probes (a two layer ReLU MLP). And they can use the probes to causally intervene and change the model's representation of the board (by using gradient descent to have the probes output the new board state) - the model now makes legal moves in the new board state even if they are not legal in the old board, and even if that board state is impossible to reach by legal play!\n","\n","I've strengthened their headline result by finding that much of their more sophisticated (and thus potentially misleading) techniques can be significantly simplified. Not only does the model learn an emergent world representation, it learns a linear emergent world representation, which can be causally intervened on in a linear way! But rather than representing \"this square has a black/white piece\", it represents \"this square has my/their piece\". The model plays both black and white moves, so this is far more natural from its perspective. With this insight, the whole picture clarifies significantly, and the model becomes far more interpretable!\n","\n","### The research process\n","\n","You can read more about the research process in [this post here](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/nhGNHyJHbrofpPbRG/p/TAz44Lb9n9yf52pv8), which I'd strongly recommend.

Rather than just learning surface level statistics about the distribution of moves, it learned to model the underlying process that generated that data. In my opinion, it's already pretty obvious that transformers can do something more than statistical correlations and pattern matching, see eg [induction heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html), but it's great to have clearer evidence of fully-fledged world models!\n","\n","For context on my investigation, it's worth analysing exactly the two pieces of evidence they had for the emergent world representation, the probes and the causal interventions, and their strengths and weaknesses.\n","\n","### Probes\n","\n","The probes give suggestive, but far from conclusive evidence. When training a probe to extract some feature from a model, it's easy to trick yourself. It's crucial to track whether the probe is just reading out the feature, or actually computing the feature itself, and reading out much simpler features from the model. In the extreme case, you could attach a much more powerful model as your \"probe\", and have it just extract the input moves, and then compute the board state from scratch! They found that linear probes did not work to recover board state (with an error rate of 20.4%): (ie, projecting the residual stream onto some 3 learned directions for each square, corresponding to empty, black and white logits). While the simplest non-linear probes (a two layer MLP with a single hidden ReLU layer) worked extremely well (an error rate of 1.7%). Further (as described in their table 2, screenshot below), these non-linear probes did not work on a randomly initialised network, and worked better on some layers than others, suggesting they were learning something real from the model.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nmxzr2zsjNtjaHh7x/b5rxfns1wxvsuomh1d79\" width=\"550\">\n","\n","### Causal interventions\n","\n","Probes on their own can mislead, and don't necessarily tell us that the model uses this representation - the probe could be extracting some vestigial features or a side effect of some more useful computation, and give a misleading picture of how the model computes the solution.

They intervene by a fairly convoluted process (detailed in the figure below, though you don't need to understand the details), which boils down to choosing a new board state, and applying gradient descend to the model's residual stream such that our probe thinks the model's residual stream represents the new board state. I have an immediate skepticism of any complex technique like this: when applying a powerful method like gradient descent it's so easy to wildly diverge from what the models original functioning is like! But the fact that the model could do the non-trivial computation of converting an edited board state into a legal move post-edit is a very impressive result!

The techniques used here seemed \"too\" powerful. The results were strong enough that something here seemed clearly real, but my intuition is that if you've really understood a model's internals, you should just be able to understand and manipulate it with far simpler techniques, like linear probes and interventions, and it's easy to be misled by more powerful techniques.\n","\n","In particular, my best guess about model internals is that the networks form [**decomposable, linear representations**](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=KiDMIteKCEXt_EkR2sZCOfbG): that the model computes a bunch of useful features, and represents these as directions in activation space. See [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#motivation) for some excellent exposition on this. This is decomposable because each feature can vary independently (from the perspective of the model - on the data distribution they're likely dependent), and linear because we can extract a feature by projecting onto that feature's direction (if the features are orthogonal - if we have something like [superposition](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=3br1psLRIjQCOv2T4RN3V6F2) it's messier). This is a natural way for models to work - they're fundamentally a series of matrix multiplications with some non-linearities stuck in convenient places, and a decomposable, linear representation allows it to extract any combination of features with a linear map!\n","\n","Under this framework, if a feature can be found by a linear probe then the model has already computed it, and if that feature is used in a circuit downstream, we should be able to causally intervene with a linear intervention, just changing the coordinate along that feature's direction. So the fascinating finding that linear probes do not work, but non-linear probes do, suggests that either the model has a fundamentally non-linear representation of features (which it is capable of using directly for downstream computation!), or there's a linear representation of simpler and more natural features, from which the probe computes board state. My prior was on a linear representation of simpler features, but the causal intervention findings felt like moderate evidence for the non-linear representation. And the non-linear representation hypothesis would be a big deal if true! If you want to reverse-engineer a model, you need to have a crisp picture of how its computation maps onto activations and weights, and this would break a lot of my beliefs about how this correspondance works! Further, linear representations are just really *convenient* to reverse-engineer, and this would make me notably more pessimistic about mechanistic interpretability working.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"56Nf7HKWHjVQ"},"source":["## Model Setup & Visualization"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a_JwiI8UHjVQ"},"source":["The best way to become less confused about a mysterious model behaviour is to mechanistically analyse it.

A few important technical details:\n","\n","- Othello games have 60 moves (the board has size 8x8, and the middle 4 squares are all occupied, so by 60 moves all squares are occupied by some color). The model's context length is 59, because it's learned to take in `moves[0:59]` and predict `moves[1:60]`. \n","- The dataset the model was trained on just consists of randomly sampled legal moves. A move in Othello is legal if and only if it captures the opponents' pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line - in which case it flips all those pieces to its own color. This means **predicting next legal moves is a nontrivial task (one might guess it requires the mdoel to track captures and board states over time)**\n","    - Because the model was trained on cross entropy loss against the actual next moves, the model's distribution converges to uniform over all next legal moves - can you see why?\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Proof - why the model learns a uniform distribution over next legal moves</summary>\n","\n","The cross entropy loss is defined as $H(p, q) = -\\sum_x p(x) \\log q(x)$, which by [Gibbs' inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs%27_inequality) is minimized when $p(x) = q(x)$. So we minimize loss when the model's distribution $q$ matches the underlying data distribution $p$, which is uniform over next legal moves.\n","\n","Note we can also prove this using Jensen's inequality, since $\\log q(x)$ is a strictly concave function. Alternatively, we can express the cross entropy loss as the sum of the underlying data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the model's distribution and the underlying distribution:\n","\n","$$\n","H(p, q) = -\\sum_x p(x) \\log q(x) = \\sum_x p(x) \\log \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} - \\sum_x p(x) \\log p(x) = D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p \\| q) + H(p)\n","$$\n","\n","so this statement becomes equivalent to the statement that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(p \\| q)$ is always non-negative and is only zero when $p(x) = q(x)$ (which can be proved in similar ways).\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","- The vocabulary size is 61, because we allow any of the 8x8 - 4 = 60 unoccupied squares to be played, plus the pass move.

Can working on toy tasks like Othello-GPT really help us to reverse-engineer LLMs like GPT-4? I'm not sure! But I think it's a plausible bet worth making.\n","\n","To walk through my reasoning, it's worth first thinking on what's holding us back - why haven't we already reverse-engineered the most capable models out there? I'd personally point to a few key factors (though note that this is my personal hot take, is not comprehensive, and I'm sure other researchers have their own views!):\n","\n","*   **Conceptual frameworks**: To reverse-engineer a transformer, you need to know how to think like a transformer. Questions like: What kinds of algorithms is it natural for a transformer to represent, and how? Are features and circuits the right way to think about it? Is it even reasonable to expect that reverse-engineering is possible? How can we tell if a hypothesis or technique is principled vs hopelessly confused? What does it even mean to have truly identified a feature or circuit?\n","    *   I personally thought [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) significantly clarified my conceptual frameworks for transformer circuits!\n","    *   This blog post is fundamentally motivated by forming better conceptual frameworks - do models form linear representations?\n","*   **Practical Knowledge/Techniques**: Understanding models is hard, and being able to do this in practice is hard. Getting better at this both looks like forming a better toolkit of techniques that help us form true beliefs about models, and also just having a bunch of practical experience with finding circuits and refining the tools - can we find any cases where they break? How can we best interpret the results?\n","    *   A concrete way this is hard is that models contain many circuits, each of which only activates on certain inputs. To identify a circuit we must first identify where it is and what it does, out of the morass! Activation patching (used in ROME, Interpretability in the Wild and refined with causal scrubbing) is an important innovation here.\n","*   **Understanding MLP Layers**: 2/3 of the parameters in transformers are in MLP layers, which process the information collected at each token position. We're pretty bad understanding them, and getting better at this is vital!\n","    *   We think these layers represent features as directions in space, and if each neuron represents a single feature, we're pretty good! But in practice this seems to be false, because of the poorly understood phenomena of superposition and polysemanticity\n","    *   [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) helped clarify my conceptual frameworks re superposition, but there's still a lot more to de-confuse! And a _lot_ of work to do to form the techniques to deal with it in practice. I'm still not aware of a single satisfying example of really understanding a circuit involving MLPs in a language model\n","*   **Scalability**: LLMs are _big_, and getting bigger all the time. Even if we solve all of the above in eg four layer transformers, this could easily involve some very ad-hoc and labour intensive techniques. Will this transfer to models far larger? And how well do the conceptual frameworks we form transformer - do they just break on models that are much more complex?\n","    *   This often overlaps with forming techniques (eg, causal scrubbing is an automated algorithm with the potential to scale, modulo figuring out many efficiency and implementation details). But broadly I don't see much work on this publicly, and would be excited to see more - in particular, checking how well our conceptual frameworks transfer, and whether all the work on small models is a bit of a waste of time!\n","        *   My personal hot take is that I'm more concerned about never getting _really_ good at interpreting a four layer model, than about scaling _if_ we're really good at four layer models - both because I just feel pretty confused about even small models, and because taking understood yet labour-intensive techniques and making them faster and more automatable seems hard but doable (especially with near-AGI systems!). But this is a complex empirical question and I could easily be wrong.\n","\n","Within this worldview, what should our research goals be? Fundamentally, I'm an empiricist - models are hard and confusing, it's easy to trick yourself, and often intuitions can mislead. The core thing of any research project is getting feedback from reality, and using it to form true beliefs about models. This can either look like forming explicit hypotheses and testing them, or exploring a model and seeing what you stumble upon, but the fundamental question is whether you have the potential to be surprised and to get feedback from reality.\n","\n","This means that any project is a trade-off between tractability and relevance to the end goal. Studying toy, algorithmic models is a double edged sword. They can be very tractable: they're clean and algorithmic which incentivises clean circuits, there's an available ground truth for what the model _should_ be doing, and they're often in a simple and nicely constrained domain. But it's extremely easy for them to cease to be relevant to real LLMs and become a nerd-snipe. (Eg, I personally spent a while working on grokking, and while this was very fun, I think it's just not very relevant to LLMs)\n","\n","It's pretty hard to do research by constantly checking whether you're being nerd-sniped, and to me there are two natural solutions:\n","\n","*   (1) To pick a concrete question you care about in language models, and to set out to specifically answer that, in a toy model that you're confident is a good proxy for that question\n","    *   Eg [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) built a pretty good toy model of residual stream superposition\n","*   (2) To pick a toy model that's a good enough proxy for LLMs _in general_, and just try hard to get as much traction on reverse-engineering that model as you can.\n","    *   Eg [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) - I think that \"train a model exactly like an LLM, but with only 1 or 2 layers\" is pretty good as proxies go, though not perfect.\n","\n","To me, working on Othello-GPT is essentially a bet on (2), that there in gneeral some are underlying principles of transformers and how they learn circuits, and that the way they manifest in Othello-GPT can teach us things about real models. This is definitely wrong in _some_ ways (I don't expect the specific circuits we find to be in GPT-3!), and it's plausible this is wrong in enough ways to be not worth working on, but I think it seems plausible enough to be a worthwhile research direction. My high-level take is just \"I think this is a good enough proxy about LLMs that studying it hard will teach us generally useful things\".\n","\n","There's a bunch of key disanalogies to be careful of! Othello is fundamentally not the same task as language: Othello is a much simpler task, there's only 60 moves, there's a rigid and clearly defined syntax with correct and incorrect answers (not a continuous mess), the relevant info about moves so far can be _fully_ captured by the current board state, and generally many sub-tasks in language will not apply.\n","\n","But it's also surprisingly analogous, at least by the standards of toy models! Most obviously, it's a transformer trained to predict the next token! But the task is also much more complex than eg modular addition, and it has to do it in weird ways! The way I'd code Othello is by doing it recursively - find the board state at move n and use it to get the state at move n+1. But transformers can't do this, they need to do things with a fixed number of serial steps but with a lot of computation in parallel (ie, at every move it must simultaneously compute the board state _at that move_ in parallel) - it's not obvious to me how to do this, and I expect that the way it's encoded will teach me a lot about how to represent certain kinds of algorithms in transformers. And it needs to be solving a bunch of sub-tasks that interact in weird ways (eg, a piece can be taken multiple times in each of four different directions), computing and remembering a lot of information, and generally forming coherent circuits.\n","\n","In the next few sections I'll argue for how finding modular circuits can help build **practical knowledge and techniques**, what we could learn from **understanding its MLPs**, and more broadly how it could act as a laboratory for forming better **conceptual frameworks** (it's clearly not a good way to study scalability lol)\n","\n","### This is not about world models\n","\n","A high-level clarification: Though the focus of the original paper was on understanding how LLMs can form emergent world models, this is _not_ why I am arguing for these research directions. My interpretation of the original paper was that it was strong evidence for the fact that it's _possible_ for \"predict the next token\" models to form world emergent models, despite never having explicit access to the ground truth of the world/board state. I personally was already convinced that this was possible, but think the authors did great work that showed this convincingly and well (and I am even more convinced after my follow-up!), and that there's not much more to say on the \"is this possible\" question.\n","\n","There's many interesting questions about whether these happen _in practice_ in LLMs and what this might look like and how to interpret it - my personal guess is that they do _sometimes_, but are pretty expensive (in terms of parameters and residual stream bandwidth) and only form when it's high value for reducing next token loss and the model is big enough to afford it. Further, there's often much cheaper hacks, eg, BingChat doesn't need to have formed an explicit chess board model to be decent at playing legal moves in chess! Probably not even for reasonably good legal play: the chess board state is _way_ easier than Othello, pieces can't even change colour! And you can get away with an implicit rather than explicit world model that just computes the relevant features from the context, eg to see where to a move a piece from, just look up the most recent point where that piece was played and look at the position it was moved to.\n","\n","But Othello is very disanalogous to language here - playing legal moves in Othello has a single, perfectly sufficient world model that I can easily code up (though not quite in four transformer layers!), and which is incredibly useful for answering the underlying task! Naively, Othello-GPT roughly seems to be spending 128 of its 512 residual stream dimensions of this model, which is very expensive (though it's probably using superposition). So while it's a proof of concept that world models are possible, I don't think the finer details here tell us much about whether these world models actually happen in real LLMs. This seems best studied by actually looking at language models, and [I think there's many exciting questions here](/posts/XNjRwEX9kxbpzWFWd/200-cop-in-mi-looking-for-circuits-in-the-wild)! (eg doing mech interp on [Patel et al's work](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gJcEM8sxHK)) The point of my investigation was more to refine our conceptual frameworks for thinking about models/transformers, and the goal of these proposed directions is to push forward transformer mech interp in general.\n","\n","## Finding Modular Circuits\n","\n","Basically all prior work on circuits (eg, [induction heads](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=_Jzi6YHRHKP1JziwdE02qdYZ), [indirect object identification](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=iWsV3s5Kdd2ca3zNgXr5UPHa), [the docstring circuit](/posts/u6KXXmKFbXfWzoAXn/a-circuit-for-python-docstrings-in-a-4-layer-attention-only), and [modular addition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05217.pdf)) have been on what I call **end-to-end** circuits. We take some model behaviour that maps certain inputs to certain outputs (eg the input of text with repetition, and the output of logits correctly predicting the repetition), and analyse the circuit going from the inputs to the outputs.\n","\n","This makes sense as a place to start! The inputs and outputs are inherently interpretable, and the most obvious thing to care about. But it stands in contrast to much of the image circuits work, that identified neurons representing interpretable features ([like curves](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/curve-circuits)) and studied how they were computed and how these were used to computed more sophisticated features (like [car wheels -> cars](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in)). Let's consider the analogy of mech interp to reverse-engineering a compiled program binary to source code. End-to-end circuits are like thinking of the source code as a single massive block of code, and identifying which sections we can ignore.\n","\n","But a natural thing to aim for is to find **variables**, corresponding to interpretable activations within the network that correspond to **features**, some property of the input. The linear representation hypothesis says that these should be directions in activation space. It's not guaranteed that LLMs _are_ modular in the sense of forming interpretable intermediate features, but this seems implied by exiasting work, eg in the residual stream (often studied with probes), or in the MLP layers ([possibly as interpretable neurons](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html#section-6-3)). If we _can_ find interpretable variables, then the reverse-engineering task becomes much easier - we can now separately analyse the circuits that form the feature(s) from the inputs or earlier features, and the circuits that use the feature(s) to compute the output logits or more complex feature.\n","\n","I call a circuit which starts or ends at some intermediate activation a **modular circuit** (in contrast to end-to-end circuits). These will likely differ in two key ways from end-to-end circuits:\n","\n","*   They will likely be **shallower**, ie involving fewer layers of composition, because they're not end-to-end. Ideally we'd be able to eg analyse a single neuron or head in isolation.\n","    *   And hopefully easier to find!\n","*   They will be **composable** - rather than needing to understand a full end-to-end circuit, we can understand different modular circuits in isolation, and need only understand the input and output features of each circuit, not the circuits that computed them.\n","    *   Hopefully this also makes it easier to predict model behaviour off distribution, by analysing how interpretable units may compose in unexpected ways!\n","\n","I think this is just obviously a thing we're going to need to get good at to have a shot at real frontier models! Modular circuits mean that we can both re-use our work from finding circuits before, and hopefully have many fewer levels of composition. But they introduce a new challenge - how do we find exactly what direction corresponds to the feature output by the first circuit, ie the **interface** between the two circuits? I see two natural ways of doing this:\n","\n","*   Exploiting a privileged basis - finding interpretable neurons or attention patterns (if this can be thought of as a feature?) and using these as our interpretable foothold.\n","    *   This is great if it works, but superposition means this likely won't be enough.\n","*   Using probes to find an interpretable foothold in the residual stream or other activations - rather than assuming there's a basis direction, we learn the correct direction\n","    *   This seems the only kind of approach that's robust to superposition, and there's [a lot of existing academic work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12452) to build upon!\n","    *   But this introduces new challenges - rather than analysing discrete units, it's now crucial to find the _right_ direction and easy to have errors. It seems hard to produce composable circuits if we can't find the right interface.\n","\n","So what does any of this have to do with Othello-GPT? I think we'll learn a lot by practicing finding modular circuits in Othello-GPT. Othello-GPT has a world model - clear evidence of spontaneous modularity - and our linear probe tells us where it is in the residual stream. And this can be intervened upon - so we know there are downstream circuits that use it. This makes it a great case study! By about layer 4, of the 512 dimensions of the residual stream, we have 64 directions corresponding to which cell has \"my colour\" and 60 directions corresponding to which cells are blank (the 4 center cells are never blank).

Othello-GPT cares a lot about the world model - the input format of a sequence of moves is hard and messy to understand, while \"is this move legal\" can be answered purely from the board state. So the model will likely devote significant resources to computing board state, forming fairly clean circuits. Yet I still don't fully know how to do it, and I expect it to be hard enough to expose a bunch of the underlying practical and conceptual issues and to teach us useful things about doing this in LLMs.\n","\n","**Gnarly conceptual issues**:\n","\n","*   How to find the _right_ directions with a probe.

The meta-level point that makes me excited about this is that linear probes are _really_ nice objects for interpretability. Fundamentally, transformers are made of linear algebra! Every component (layer, head and neuron) reads its input from the residual stream with a linear map, and writes it output by adding it to the residual stream, which is a _really_ nice structure.\n","\n","**Probing across layers**: One way this is nice is that we can immediately get a foothold into understanding how the world model is computed. The residual stream is the sum of the embeddings and the output of every previous head and neuron. So when we apply a linear map like our probe, we can also break this down into a direct contribution from each previous head and neuron.\n","\n","This is the same key idea as direct logit attribution, but now our projection is onto a probe direction rather than the unembed direction for a specific next token. This means we can immediately zoom in to the step of the circuit immediately before the probe, and see which components matter for each cell!\n","\n","As an example, let's look at move 20 in this game:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/heamef6n9xzedn5lkd1a\" width=\"300\">\n","\n","The probe can perfectly predict the board state by layer 4\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/cozpptrltfdnolvyjvfo\" width=\"500\">\n","\n","We can now look at how much the output of each attention and each MLP layer contributed to this (concretely we take the output of each attention and each MLP layer on move 30, and project them onto the is\\_blank direction and the is\\_mine direction for each cell, and plot this as a heatmap - [check the accompanying notebook for details](https://neelnanda.io/othello-notebook)). The MLP layer contributions to whether a cell has my or their colour is particularly interesting - we can see that it normally does nothing, but has a strong effect on the central stripe of cells that were just taken by the opponent - plausibly MLPs calculate when a cell is taken, and attention aggregates this?

These represent over 2/3 of the parameters in models, but we've had much more traction understanding attention-focused circuits. I'm not aware of a single public example of what I'd consider a well-understood circuit involving transformer MLP layers (beyond possibly my work on modular addition in a one layer transformer, but that's cheating). There are tantalising hints about the circuits they're used in in eg [SoLU](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/solu/index.html) and [ROME](https://rome.baulab.info/), but I broadly still feel confused re what is mechanistically going on. I think this is a thing we obviously need to make progress on as a field! And I think we'll learn useful things from trying to understand Othello-GPT's MLP layers!\n","\n","What could progress on understanding MLPs in general look like? I think that we both need to get practice just studying MLP layers, and that we need to form clearer conceptual frameworks. A lot of our intuitions about transformer neurons come from image models, where neurons seem to (mostly?) represent features, have ReLU activations, and seem to be doing fairly discrete kinds of logic, eg \"if car wheel present and car body present and car window present (in the right places) -> it's a car\".\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/ze4jai5ioub31ovgewdj\" width=\"800\">\n","\n","Transformers are different in a bunch of ways - there's attention layers, there's a residual stream (with significantly smaller dimension than the number of neurons in each layer!), and smoother and weirder GELU activations. Most importantly, polysemanticity seem to be a much bigger deal - single neurons often represent multiple features rather than a feature per neuron - and we think this is because models are using superposition - they represent features as linear combinations of neurons and use this to compress in more features than they have dimensions. This was argued for pretty convincingly in [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html), but their insights were derived from a toy model, which can easily be misleading. I'm not aware of any work so far exhibiting superposition or properly testing the predictions of that paper in a real model.

The model needs to compress a fairly complex and wide-ranging set of features and computation into just eight layers, and the details of _how_ it does this will hopefully expose some principles about what is and is not natural for a transformer to express in MLP neurons.\n","\n","What would progress here look like? My high-level take is that a solid strategy is just going out, looking for interesting neurons, and trying to understand them deeply - no grander purpose or high-level questions about the model needed. I'd start with similar goals as I gave in [the previous section](/posts/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/othello-gpt-future-work-i-am-excited-about#Finding_Modular_Circuits) - look for the neurons that are used to compute the probe, and directly used by the probe. I also outline [some further preliminary results](/posts/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/othello-gpt-future-work-i-am-excited-about#Preliminary_Results_On_Modular_Circuits) that may serve as inspiration.\n","\n","I've learned a lot from case studies looking deeply at concrete case studies of circuits in models: [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) found backup heads (that took over when earlier heads were ablated) and negative heads (that systematically boosted _incorrect_ solutions), and [the docstring circuit](/posts/u6KXXmKFbXfWzoAXn/a-circuit-for-python-docstrings-in-a-4-layer-attention-only) found a polysemantic attention head, and a head which used the causal attention mask to re-derive positional information.

Empirical data here seems really valuable! Though there are some important ways that the setup of Othello-GPT differs from their toy model. Notably, they study continuous (uniform \\[0, 1\\]) features, while Othello-GPT's features seem likely to be binary (on or off), as they're discrete and logical functions of the board state and of the previous moves. Binary features seem more representative of language, especially early token-level features like bigrams and multi-token words, and are also easier to put into superposition, because you don't need to distinguish low values of the correct feature from high values of the incorrect feature\n","\n","A broader point is whether we expect Othello-GPT to use superposition at all? Their model has more features to represent than dimensions, and so _needs_ to use superposition to pack things in. It's not obvious to me how many features Othello-GPT wants to represent, and how this compares to the number of dimensions - my _guess_ is that it still needs to use superposition, but it's not clear. Some considerations:\n","\n","*   There's actually a lot of very specific features it might want to learn - eg in the board state -> output logit parts there seems to be a neuron representing C0==BLANK & D1==THEIR'S & E2==MINE, ie can I place a counter in C0 such that it flanks exactly one counter on the diagonal line to the down and right - if this kind of thing is useful, it suggests the model is dealing with a large combinatorial explosion of cases for the many, many similar configurations!\n","    *   Further, computing the board state from the moves also involves a lot of messy cases, eg dealing with the many times and directions a piece can be flipped and combining this all into a coherent story.\n","        *   Reminder: Transformers are not recurrent - it can't compute the board state at move n from the state at move n-1, it needs to compute the state at every move _simultaneously_ with just a few layers of attention to move partial computation forwards. This is actually really hard, and it's not obvious to me how you'd implement this in a transformer!\n","*   There are two different kinds of superposition, residual stream superposition and neuron superposition (ie having more features than dimensions in the residual stream vs in the MLP hidden layer).\n","    *   The residual stream has 512 dimensions, but there's 8 layers of 2048 neurons each (plus attention heads) - unless many neurons do nothing or are highly redundant, it seems very likely that there's residual stream superposition!\n","        *   Though note that it's plausible it just has way fewer than 2048 features worth computing, and is massively over-parametrised. I'm not sure what to think here!\n","        *   The board state alone consumes 25% of the dimensions, if each feature gets a dedicated dimension, and I expect there's probably a bunch of other features worth computing and keeping around?\n","\n","Concrete questions I'd want to test here - note that the use of dropout may obfuscate these questions (by incentivising redundancy and backup circuits), and this may be best answered in a model without dropout. These also may be best answered in a smaller model with fewer layers and a narrower residual stream, and so with a stronger incentive for superposition!:\n","\n","*   Do important features get dedicated dimensions in the residual stream? (ie, orthogonal to all other features)\n","    *   Guesses for important features - whether black or white is playing, the board state, especially features which say which center cells have my colour vs their's.\n","*   Conversely, can we find evidence that there _is_ overlap between features in the residual stream?\n","    *   This is surprisingly thorny, since you need to distinguish this kind of genuine interference vs intentional overlapping, eg from the source of the first feature actually wanting to contribute a bit to feature two as well.\n","*   Do the important neurons seem monosemantic?\n","    *   Important could mean many things eg high effect when patching, high average activation or standard deviation of activation, high cost when ablated, or any other range of measurements, high gradient or gradient x activation\n","    *   My workflow would be to use the probe and unembed to interpret neuron weights, max activating dataset examples to help form a hypothesis, and then use a spectrum plot to properly analyse it (discussed more below).\n","*   Do we get seemingly unrelated features sharing a neuron?

This is actually a fair bit harder to interpret than language, since \"what are the connections between these sequences of moves\" isn't obvious. I got the most traction from studying board state - in particular, the average number of times each cell is non-empty, and the average number of times a cell is mine vs their's.

But our probe was computed after layer 6, when there's a lot of extraneous information that probably obscures the blankness information - probably, the probe also learned that if there's going to be a high logit for a cell then that cell is definitely blank, and so the blank directions are partially aligned with the unembed directions. Though on another interpretation, `is_blank` and the unembed are _intentionally_ aligned, because the model knows there's a causal link and so uses the `is_blank` subspace to also contribute to the relevant unembed.\n","\n","And we see that the alignment with the unembed is even higher! (Around cosine sim of 0.8 to 0.9)\n","\n","<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/jckacomrew1ju1utpetf\" width=\"800\">\n","\n","## A Transformer Circuit Laboratory\n","\n","My final category is just the meta level point that I'm confused in many ways about the right **conceptual frameworks** when thinking about transformer circuits, and think that there's a lot of ways we could make progress here! Just as Othello-GPT helped provide notable evidence for the hypothesis that models form linear representations of features, I hope it can help clarify some of these - by concretely understanding what happens inside of it, we can make more informed guesses about transformers in general. Here's a rough brainstorm of weird hypotheses and confusions about what we might find inside transformers - I expect that sufficient investigation of Othello-GPT will shed light on many of them!\n","\n","Since Othello-GPT is an imperfect proxy for LLMs, it's worth reflecting on what evidence here looks like. I'm most excited about Othello-GPT providing \"existence proofs\" for mysterious phenomena like memory management: case studies of specific phenomena, making it seem more likely that they arise in real language models. Proofs that something was not used/needed are great, but need to be comprehensive enough to overcome the null hypothesis of \"this was/wasn't there but we didn't look hard enough\", which is a high bar!\n","\n","*   Does it do **memory management** in the residual stream? Eg overwriting old features when they're no longer needed. I'd start by looking for neurons with high negative cosine sim between their input and output vectors, ie which basically erase some direction.\n","    *   One hypothesis is that it implicitly does memory management by increasing the residual stream norm over time - LayerNorm scales it to have fixed norm, so this suppresses earlier features. If this is true, we might instead observe **signal boosting** - key features get systematically boosted over time (eg whether we're playing black or white)\n","    *   This might come up with cells that flip many times during previous moves - maybe the model changes its guess for the cell's colour back and forth several times as it computes more flips? Do each of these write to the probe direction and overwrite the previous one, or is it something fancier?\n","*   Do heads and neurons seem like the right units of analysis of the model? Vs eg entire layers, superposition-y linear combinations of neurons/heads, subsets of heads, etc.\n","*   Do components (heads and neurons) tend to form **tightly integrated circuits** where they strongly compose with just a few other components to form a coherent circuit, or tend to be **modular**, where each component does something coherent in isolation and composes with many other components.\n","    *   For example, an induction head could be either tightly integrated (the previous token head is highly coupled to the induction head and not used by anything else, and just communicates an encoded message about the previous token directly to the induction head) or could form two separate modules, where the previous token head's output writes to a \"what was in the previous position\" subspace that many heads (including the induction head!) read from\n","        *   My guess is the latter, but I don't think anyone's checked! Most working finding concrete circuits seems to focus on patching style investigations on a narrow distribution, rather than broadly checking behaviour on diverse inputs.\n","    *   On a given input, can we clearly detect which components are composing? Is _this_ sparse?\n","*   When two components (eg two heads or a head and a neuron) compose with each other, do they tend to write to some shared subspace that many other components read and write from, or is there some specific encod\n","    *   Do components form modules vs integrated circuits vs etc.\n","*   Can we find examples of head polysemanticity (a head doing different things in different contexts) or head redundancy (multiple heads doing seemingly the same thing).\n","    *   Do we see backup heads? That is, heads that compensate for an earlier head when that head is ablated. This model was trained with attention dropout, so I expect they do!\n","        *   Do these backup heads do anything when _not_ acting as backups?\n","        *   Can we understand mechanistically how the backup behaviour is implemented?\n","        *   Are there backup backup heads?\n","    *   Can we interpret the heads at all? I found this pretty hard, but there must be something legible here!\n","    *   If we find head redundancy, can we distinguish between head superposition (there's a single \"effective head\" that consists of a linear combination of these )\n","    *   Can we find heads which seem to have an attention pattern doing a single thing, but whose OV circuit is used to convey a bunch of different information, read by different downstream circuits\n","    *   Can we find heads which have very similar attention patterns (ie QK circuits) whose OV circuits add together to simulate a single head with an OV circuit of twice the rank?\n","*   Is LayerNorm ever used as a meaningful non-linearity (ie, the scale factor differs between tokens in a way that does useful computation), or basically constant? Eg, can you linearly replace it?\n","    *   Are there emergent features in the residual stream? (ie dimensions in the standard basis that are much bigger than the rest). Do these disproportionately affect LayerNorm?\n","*   The model has clearly learned some redundancy (because it was trained with dropout, but also likely would learn some without any dropout). How is this represented mechanistically?\n","    *   Is it about having backup circuits that takeover when the first thing is ablated? Multiple directions for the same feature? Etc.\n","*   Can you find more evidence for or against the hypothesis that features are represented linearly?\n","    *   If so, do these get represented orthogonally?\n","*   Ambitiously, do we have a shot at figuring out _everything_ that the model is doing? Does it seem remotely possible to fully-reverse engineer it?\n","    *   Is there a long tail of fuzzy, half-formed features that aren't clean enough to interpret, but slightly damage loss if ablated? Are there neurons that just do nothing either way?\n","    *   Some ambitious plans for interpretability for alignment involve aiming for [enumerative safety](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#strategic-safety), the idea that we might be able to enumerate _all_ features in a model and inspect this for features related to dangerous capabilities or intentions. Seeing whether this is remotely possible for Othello-GPT may be a decent test run.\n","*   Do the residual stream or internal head vectors have a privileged basis? Both with [statistical tests like kurtosis](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/privileged-basis/index.html), and in terms of whether you can actually interp directions in the standard basis?\n","*   Do transformers behave like [ensembles of shallow paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06431)? Where each meaningful circuit tends to only involve a few of the 16 sublayers, and makes heavy use of the residual stream (rather than 16 serial steps of computation).\n","    *   Prior circuits work and techniques like [the logit lens](/posts/AcKRB8wDpdaN6v6ru/interpreting-gpt-the-logit-lens) seems to heavily imply this, but it would be good to get more data!\n","    *   A related hypothesis - when a circuit involves several components (eg a feature is computed by several neurons in tandem) are these always in the same layer? One of my fears is that superposition gives rise to features that are eg linear combinations of 5 neurons, but that these are spread across adjacent layers!\n","\n","## Where to start?\n","\n","If you've read this far, hopefully I've convinced you there are interesting directions here that could be worth working on!

Note that these are just preliminary suggestions - the above sections outline my underlying philosophy of which questions I'm excited about and a bunch of scattered thoughts about how to make progress on them. If there's a direction you personally feel excited about, you should just jump in.\n","\n","Ideas for gentle starter projects (Note that I have not actually tried these - I expect them to be easy, but I expect at least one is actually cursed! If you get super stuck, just move on):\n","\n","*   How does the model decide that the cell for the current move is not blank?\n","    *   What's the natural way for a transformer to implement this? (Hint: Do you need information about previous moves to answer this?)\n","    *   At which layer has the model figured this out?\n","    *   Try patching between two possibilities for the current move (with the same previous game) and look at what's going on\n","*   Pick a specific cell (eg B3). How does the model compute that it's blank?\n","    *   I'd start by studying the model on a few specific moves. At which layer does the model conclude that it's blank? Does this come from any specific head or neuron?\n","    *   Conceptually, a cell is not blank if and only if it was played as a previous move - how could a transformer detect this? (Hint: A single attention head per cell would work)\n","*   Take a game where a center cell gets flipped many times. Look at what colour the model thinks that cell is, after each layer and move. What patterns can you see? Can you form any guesses about what's going on? (This is a high-level project - the goal is to form hypotheses, not to reach clear answers)\n","*   Take the `is_my_colour` direction for a specific cell (eg D7) and look for neurons whose input weight has high cosine similarity with this. Look at this neuron's cosine sim with every other probe direction, and form a guess about what it's doing (if it's a mess then try another neuron/cell). Example guesses might be\n","    *   Then look at the max activating dataset examples (eg the top 10 over 50 games) and check if your guess worked!\n","    *   Extension: Plot a [spectrum plot](/posts/qgK7smTvJ4DB8rZ6h/othello-gpt-future-work-i-am-excited-about#Preliminary_Results_On_Neuron_Interpretability) and check how monosemantic it actually is\n","*   Repeat the above for the `is_blank` direction.\n","*   Take the average of the even minus the average of the odd positional embeddings to get an \"I am playing white\" direction. Does this seem to get its own dedicated dimension, or is it in superposition?\n","    *   A hard part about answering this question is distinguishing there being non-orthogonal features, vs other components doing memory management and eg systematically signal boosting the \"I am playing white\" direction so it's a constant fraction of the residual stream. Memory management should act approximately the same between games, while other features won't.\n","\n","### Cleaning Up\n","\n","This was (deliberately!) a pretty rushed and shallow investigation, and I cut a bunch of corners. There's some basic cleaning up I would do if I wanted to turn this into a real paper or build a larger project, and this might be a good place to start!\n","\n","*   Training a better probe: I cut a lot of corners in training this probe... Some ideas:\n","    *   Train it on both black and white moves!

Check how well the current probe works on early and late moves.\n","    *   The state of different cells will be correlated (eg a corner can only be filled if a neighbouring cell is filled), so the probes may be non-orthogonal for boring reasons. Does it help to constrain them to be orthogonal?\n","    *   What's the right layer to train a probe on?\n","    *   The probe is 3 vectors (three-way logistic regression), but I want a `is_blank_vs_filled` and `is_mine_vs_theirs_conditional_on_not_being_blank` direction - what's the most principled way of doing this?\n","*   Rigorously testing interventions: I'm pretty convinced that intervening the probe does _something_, but\n","    *   Currently I take the _current_ coordinate with respect to the probe direction, negate that, and then scale. Plausibly, this is dumb and the magnitude of the original coordinate doesn't matter, and I should instead replace it with a constant magnitude.

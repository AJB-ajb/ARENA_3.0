## AI Safety

As AIs become more powerful and are deployed autonomously in high-stakes contexts, it will be increasingly important that we can control them and prevent them from causing harmful outcomes. We need to figure out how to build tools that increase our defence against AI risks, so that we can *actually secure* the amazing upsides brought by AI progress. In order to do this, there is a collection of highly consequential and technically rich problems that we must solve, and the aim of this course is to equip you with the ML engineering skills to tackle them.

If you aren't very familiar with AI safety, we recommend watching this video and reading some of the resources below:

> * [Research by **DeepMind**](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity/) has shown examples of real-world reinforcement learning agents demonstrating one aspect of the AI alignment problem: they elucidate specification gaming, one class of phemenona showing how difficult getting an AI's actions to align with human goals can be, and how this can result in strange and unexpected failures.
> * [This post by **Paul Christiano**](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/AyNHoTWWAJ5eb99ji/another-outer-alignment-failure-story) sketches out a possible scenario of how AI development could go wrong over time if we don't solve the alignment problem. While this is only a story, it is very useful for thinking about how AI take-off could look in the real-world.
> * [This paper by **Hendrycks et al.**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13916), which gives a clear and broad overview of the technical problems in AI safety.
> * [This paper by **Ngo et al.**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.00626) gives an overview of how the alignment problem interacts with the modern AI paradigm of deep learning.
> * [This course by **BlueDot Impact**](https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment) provides resources on a multitude of topics in technical AI safety, with a broad array of introductory papers and blogposts, so that you can gain an overview of the field as it exists today.

### Why ARENA
 > My first proper exposure to technical AI safety content was at the [MLAB workshop run by Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/mlab) in 2022. Attending this, I was struck by how different the material felt to previous AI safety work I'd read about and engaged in. I'd participated in some virtual reading and writing groups before, and tried to get involved in the work being done, but if I could summarize the difference ‚Äî MLAB felt like I was doing actual AI safety technical research, rather than just impersonating what I thought an AI safety technical researcher would be doing. Unfortunately, this kind of experience is common in pre-paradigmatic fields where there are so many different approaches and perspectives that can be brought to bear, and limited ability to evaluate the effectiveness of your research directions. But with certain areas of safety research entering the mainstream and accruing more funding/interest/literature, programs like MLAB which aim to provide a concrete guided introduction to these topics become more feasible.
>
>This is where ARENA came in. It was designed partly to be a spiritual successor to MLAB, but with the ability to take deeper dives into specific areas of technical AI safety like interpretability, RLHF, and evals. The first iteration was run with just five participants out of a small office room in Borough, but since then has grown into a large community of people who are passionate about AI safety research, and participants in the program have gone on to programs like [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) and [AI safety camp](https://aisafety.camp/), as well as full-time roles at companies like [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) and [Conjecture](https://www.conjecture.dev/).
>
>ARENA certainly couldn't exist without the wealth of fantastic open-source material that has been published over the last few years: from Anthropic's [transformer circuits thread](https://transformer-circuits.pub/), to Neel Nanda's [TransformerLens library](https://transformerlensorg.github.io/TransformerLens/), to the original MLAB material, to many more. But with all this material floating around, it can be hard to know what to focus on or prioritize. I see the purpose of ARENA largely as structure and curation ‚Äî it provides a guided path through the material, for anyone who finds themselves overwhelmed by the amount of technical AI safety content out there. My hope is that both the material in and the community around ARENA continues to grow over the coming months and years, and that for people who possess technical skills but lack specific domain knowledge, it can serve as a springboard for their career development in technical AI safety research!

## About this page

This page was made using an app called Streamlit. It's hosted from the main course [GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0). It provides a very simple way to display markdown, as well as more advanced features like interactive plots and animations. This is how the instructions for each day will be presented.

On the left, you can see a sidebar (or if it's collapsed, you will be able to see if you click on the small arrow in the top-left to expand it). This sidebar should show a page called `Home` (which is the page you're currently reading), as well as one for each of the different parts of today's exercises.

If you want to change to dark mode, you can do this by clicking the three dots in the top-right, then navigating to Settings ‚Üí Choose app theme.

## How to access the course

### Option 1: Colab

This option is recommended if either of the following is true:

* You have limited access to GPU support
* You want to avoid the hassle of setting up your own environment

You can see all the Colab files in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e_qBy1YR1X9q5uMw3X6rACfuVXx9ivH-?usp=sharing). Also, you can get individual links in the dropdown below.

<details>
<summary>Click this dropdown for links to each of the colab exercises.</summary>

<div style='text-align: center'>

COLAB_NOTEBOOKS

</div>
</details>

For each of these sections, you can make a copy of the **exercises** notebooks in your own drive, and fill in the code cells whenever indicated. Use the **solutions** notebook when you're stuck (they have all code cells filled in & run, and output displayed).

### Option 2: VS Code

This is the option we strongly recommend for all participants of the in-person ARENA program, and for people who are more comfortable with things like setting up their coding workspace (and who have access to a good GPU). You'll be cloning the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0) and creating files in VS Code to work through the exercises one by one.

The repo has the following basic structure:

REPO_STRUCTURE

Each chapter has its own directory, which contains `instructions` (the files here generate the Streamlit page you're currently reading) and `exercises` (which contains the material you'll work through, organized by chapter sections). There are 2 suggested ways to work through the exercises:

1. Create a file `answers.py` or `.ipynb` in the same directory as the exercises (e.g. FIRST_EXERCISE_DIR). Work through the Streamlit page, copying over and running code in your file, and filling in code at appropriate places (i.e. the exercises). You can also look at the dropdowns in the Streamlit page to check your answers / see what output you should be getting.
2. Work through the exercises notebook (e.g. `FIRST_EXERCISE_NB`), running the cells in sequential order and filling in code in cells as appropriate. You can also look at the corresponding solutions notebook (e.g. `FIRST_SOLNS_NB`) to check your answers / see what output you should be getting. This experience is functionally the same as the Colab experience (in fact, the Colabs are generated from these notebook files).

Note ‚Äî if you choose this option, then you may require more compute than your laptop can provide. If you're following this material virtually, you may want to consider a cloud provider such as Lambda Labs or RunPod or VastAI. Instructions for these are found below ‚Äî if you follow those, then the exercises in the dropdown below are redundant.

<details>
<summary>Click this dropdown for setup instructions (if you're not using a virtual machine).</summary>

* Make & activate a virtual environment.
    * We strongly recommend using `conda` for this. You can install `conda` [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), and find basic instructions [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
    * The command for creating a new env is `conda create --name arena-env python=3.11`.
* Activate the conda environment using `conda activate arena-env`.
* Clone the GitHub repo using `git clone https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0.git`.
* Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    * Make sure you've navigated to the root directory of the repo before running this command.

</details>

Another important point - **don't mix and match the Colab / notebook options and the Streamlit / answers file options**. For example, copying and pasting code from Streamlit to run them on the Colabs might lead to errors. Either work only in the exercises/solutions notebooks, or work from the Streamlit page & your own `answers` file.

### System Requirements 

For ARENA, we've tried to make sure that the computationally intensive material can easily be scaled down to run on cheap GPUs to make the program as accessible as possible. If you're not using Colab, we recommend hiring a machine that at least meets the following requirements.

* **GPU**: A GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM. >12GB would be best. You do not need lots of compute for this material, and having more usually won't make things any better (with the exception of transformer training day). Here's a table of budget cards avaliable on VastAI (though check [here](https://vast.ai/pricing) for up-to-date pricing).
  
 <details>
<summary>Comparison of various GPUs on VastAI</summary> 
  
  
| GPU Model        | VRAM | Performance (FP32 TFLOPS) | Cost (USD/hour) |
|------------------|------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| RTX A5000        | 24GB | 27.5                      | ~0.22 - 0.27    |
| **RTX A4000**    | 16GB | 20.6                      | ~0.15           |
| RTX 3090         | 24GB | 35.3                      | ~0.25 - 0.3     |
| RTX 3080         | 10GB | 29.2                      | ~0.20           |
| RTX 3070         | 8GB  | 19.8                      | ~0.11 - 0.16    |
| **RTX 3060**     | 12GB | 12.0                      | ~0.10 - 0.16    |
| Tesla V100       | 16GB | 12.5                      | ~0.25           |

</details>

We recommend the **RTX 3060** or the **RTX A4000**. Anything beyond these cards (e.g. A6000, RTX 4000 series, A100s) is overkill.

* **RAM** The usual rule of thumb is 2x your VRAM, though 16GB of RAM is probably plenty.

* **HDD** 50GB of space should be plenty, and keeping the HDD space down means the on-demand cost while
your machine is idle should be very low (<10USD/month).

* **CPU** Whatever comes with the GPU node is fine.

* **Bandwidth** Often forgotten, but very important. For many of the days, the material starts with downloading a large corpus of data, or a large pretrained model (on the order of a few GBs). We recommend at least 100Mbps of bandwidth. If that's not an option, maybe pre-run the cells the night before to make sure you have everything downloaded ahead of time.

## Virtual Machines

This section discusses how to connect using virtual machines. This is relevant if you want to use Option 2 (VS Code) but you don't meet the system requirements (or you just want things to run faster).

*If these instructions don't work for you, please let us know ‚Äî there are many different errors that can be encountered during VM setup, and we're keen to try and make these instructions more robust and helpful.*

### Comparison of cloud providers

* **Lambda Labs** is by far the easiest to use, and the most reliable.
    * The machines come pre-installed with most of the PyTorch libraries you'll need, but it's pricer than other platforms.
    * At the time of writing, their cheapest options are 1x RTX 6000 (24GB VRAM) for 0.50USD/hour, or 1x A6000 (48GB VRAM) for 0.80USD/hour.
    * You cannot easily pause the machine without deleting all your data and having to reinstall each day, so this can get expensive if you leave it running overnight.
    * Disadvantage: often they have very low availability (all options greyed out), so you might not be able to rent a machine.
* **RunPod** [Coming soon!]
* **VastAI** is a lot cheaper than the other options, and I've found it to be *mostly* reliable.
    * The machines come with very little pre-installed, so you'll have to install most of the libraries yourself (though we show you how!).
    * People lease out their machines for hire on VastAI, so you shouldn't use this for anything private.
    * Each node charges somewhere in the range of 0.10 - 0.30USD/GB/month, so with only 32GB of HDD space, you can easily keep the idle cost down to <10USD/month, and the cost while working to <2USD/day.
    * You can easily resume your work from where you left off. Don't forget to pause your instance before you finish for the day!
    * The machines are heavily customizable, so make sure you select one with enough HDD space and bandwidth.

### Setup instructions for cloud providers

<details>
<summary>Setup instructions for Lambda Labs.</summary>

#### Instructions for signing up

Sign up for an account [here](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud).

Add an **SSH key** (Lambda Labs gives you an option to create one). Give it a name like `arena_key`.

When you create it, it will automatically be downloaded. The file may have a `.pem` extension ‚Äî this is a common container format for keys or certificates.

<br>

#### VS Code remote-ssh extension

The [**remote ssh extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) is very useful for abstracting away some of the messy command-line based details of SSH. You should install this extension now.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/architecture-ssh.png" width="600">

At this point, the instructions differ between Windows and Linux/MacOS.

##### Windows

Having installed the SSH extension, Windows may have automatically created a .ssh file for you, and it will be placed in `C:\Users\<user>` by default. If it hasn't done this, then you should create one yourself (you can do this from the Windows command prompt via `md C:\Users\<user>\.ssh`).

Move your downloaded SSH key into this folder. Then, set permissions on the SSH key:
        
* Right click on file, press ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù, then go to the ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù tab.
* Click ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù, then ‚ÄúDisable inheritance‚Äù in the window that pops up.
    
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/instruction1.png" width="500">

* Choose the first option ‚ÄúConvert inherited permissions‚Ä¶‚Äù

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/instruction2.png" width="500">

* Go back to the ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù tab, click "Edit" to change permissions, and remove every user except the owner.
    * You can check who the owner is by going back to "Security -> Advanced" and looking for the "Owner" field at the top of the window).

##### Linux / MacOS

* Make your `.ssh` directory using the commands `mkdir -p ~/.ssh` then `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`.
* Set permissions on the key: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/arena_key`

<br>

#### Launch your instance

Go back to the Lambda Labs website, navigate to "instances", and click "Launch instance".

You'll see several options, some of them might be greyed out if unavailable. Pick an A100 if possible; otherwise an A10 will also do for most exercises in this course.

Enter your SSH key name. Choose a region (your choice here doesn't really matter for our purposes).

Once you finish this process, you should see your GPU instance is running:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_instance.png" width="700">

You should also see an SSH LOGIN field, which will have the form `ssh <user>@<ip-address>`.

Now, you should set up a **config file** ‚Äî this will remove the need to use long command line arguments, e.g. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/arena_key user@instance-ip-address`.

Open the command palette (this is Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows, Cmd+Shift+P for Mac), search for the option "Open SSH Configuration File...", then click on the option `C:\\Users\\<user>\\.ssh\\config` for Windows / `~/.ssh/config` for Linux/MacOS. If you haven't used this file before, then an empty config file will open. You should copy in the following instructions:

```c
Host arena
    HostName <ip-address>
    IdentityFile <path-to-ssh-key>
    User <user>
```

where `<ip-address>` and `<user>` come from the **SSH LOGIN** field in the table, and `<path-to-ssh-key>` is the path at which you saved the SSH key. So from my Windows machine, this would look like:

```c
Host arena
    HostName 150.136.64.192
    IdentityFile C:/Users/calsm/.ssh/arena_key
    User <user>
```

<br>

#### Connect to your instance

Open the command palette, and search for & choose the option "Connect to Host...". The host `arena` should appear as one of the hosts. Choose this option.

A new VS Code window will open up. If you're asked if you want to install the recommended extensions for Python, click yes. If you're asked to choose an OS (Windows, Mac or Linux), choose Linux.

Click on the file explorer icon in the top-left, and open the directory `ubuntu` (or whichever directory you want to use as your working directory in this machine). 

And there you go ‚Äî you're all set! 

To check your GPU is working, you can open a Python or Notebook file and run `!nvidia-smi`. You should see GPU information which matches the machine you chose from the Lambda Labs website, and is different from the result you get from running this command on your local machine. 

Another way to check out your GPU For instance is to run the PyTorch code `torch.cuda.get_device_name()`. For example, this is what I see after SSHing in:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_type.png" width="500">
<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gpu_type_2.png" width="450">

You can also use `torch.cuda.get_device_properties` (which takes your device as an argument).

Once you've verified this is working, you can start running code on GPUs. The easiest way to do this is just to drag and drop your files into the file explorer window on the left hand side.

<summary>Setup instructions for RunPod.</summary>

#### Instructions for signing up

Sign up for an account [here](https://www.runpod.io/console/signup).

Add an **SSH key**, by running the command `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` (in Windows PowerShell if you're using Windows, or Terminal if you're using Linux / MacOS). Give it a name like `arena_key`. Make sure you know where it was generated (later in the instructions, you'll move it into the right folder).

<br>

#### VS Code remote-ssh extension

The [**remote ssh extension**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) is very useful for abstracting away some of the messy command-line based details of SSH. You should install this extension now.

##### Windows

Having installed the SSH extension, Windows may have automatically created a .ssh file for you, and it will be placed in `C:\Users\<user>` by default. If it hasn't done this, then you should create one yourself (you can do this from the Windows command prompt via `md C:\Users\<user>\.ssh`).

Move your downloaded SSH key into this folder. Then, set permissions on the SSH key:
        
* Right click on file, press ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù, then go to the ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù tab.
* Click ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù, then ‚ÄúDisable inheritance‚Äù in the window that pops up.
    
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/instruction1.png" width="500">

* Choose the first option ‚ÄúConvert inherited permissions‚Ä¶‚Äù

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/instruction2.png" width="500">

* Go back to the ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù tab, click "Edit" to change permissions, and remove every user except the owner.
    * You can check who the owner is by going back to "Security -> Advanced" and looking for the "Owner" field at the top of the window).

##### Linux / MacOS

* Make your `.ssh` directory using the commands `mkdir -p ~/.ssh` then `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`.
* Set permissions on the key: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/arena_key`

<br>

#### Launch your instance

Go back to the RunPod website, and navigate to "Community Cloud". You'll see several options, including (hopefully) A100s. 

You'll see several options, some of them might be greyed out if unavailable. Pick an A100 if possible; otherwise an A10 will also do for most exercises in this course.

Click "Deploy" on your chosen machine. A new options menu will open. Do the following:

* You can click on the "Customize Deployment" button, to give yourself more storage (I usually go with 50GB on Container Disk (Temporary) and 50GB on Volume Disk (Persistent). You might be told that there isn't enough capacity when you try to deploy, in which case go back to this menu and make the amount smaller). Click "Set Overrides".
* In the "Type to search for a template" option, choose the version of PyTorch less than version 2 (this will probably be 1.13.1).
* Click "Continue", then "Deploy" ‚Äî this should launch your instance.

Enter your SSH key name. Choose a region (your choice here doesn't really matter for our purposes).

Once you finish this process, you should see your GPU instance is running, when you navigate to "Pods" on the left hand sidebar:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/runpod-instructions.png" width="980">

Click the purple dropdown button on the right, and press "Connect". Click on the "TCP Port Mappings" tab. You should see something like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/runpod-instructions-2.png" width="480">

You can see the IP address `104.255.9.187` (which we'll call `<ip-address>` from now on), and the external port `13212` (which we'll call `<port>` from now on).

*(Note ‚Äî sometimes I don't see any IP addresses in this option, instead the message "This pod either does not support direct public ip networking, or you have not exposed any tcp ports." I don't know exactly why this happens, but starting a new machine with less extra storage often fixes this for me.)*

Now, you should set up a **config file** ‚Äî this will remove the need to use long command line arguments, e.g. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/arena_key user@instance-ip-address`.

Open the command palette (this is Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows, Cmd+Shift+P for Mac), search for the option "Open SSH Configuration File...", then click on the option `C:\\Users\\<user>\\.ssh\\config` for Windows / `~/.ssh/config` for Linux/MacOS. If you haven't used this file before, then an empty config file will open. You should copy in the following instructions:

```c
Host arena
    HostName <ip-address>
    User root
    IdentityFile <path-to-ssh-key>
    Port <port>
```

With all values filled in.

* Make your `.ssh` directory using the commands `mkdir -p ~/.ssh` then `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`.
* Set permissions on the key: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/arena_key`

<br>

#### Launch your instance

Navigate in the sidebar to "Account", and copy your ssh key into the "Change SSH Keys" text box. Click "SET SSH KEY".

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/vastai_img/keys.png" width="600">

Navigate in the sidebar to "Search". You'll see several options avaliable to rent,
and sliders to filter by GPU type, RAM, HDD space, etc.

Filter by

* at least 50GB of disk space
* at least 100Mbps of bandwidth
* One of the GPUs in the above table (RTX 3000-series, A4000, A5000, V10).

Click "Rent" to spin up your machine.

You can view the state of the machine under the "Instances" tab.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/vastai_img/node3.png" width="600">

Click the blue "Open SSH Interface" button. You should see something like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/vastai_img/ip.png" width="600">

You can see the IP address `188.241.30.201` (which we'll call `<ip-address>` from now on), and the external port `41212` (which we'll call `<port>` from now on).

Now, you should set up a **config file** ‚Äî this will remove the need to use long command line arguments, e.g. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/arena_key user@instance-ip-address`.

Open the command palette (this is Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows, Cmd+Shift+P for Mac), search for the option "Open SSH Configuration File...", then click on the option `C:\\Users\\<user>\\.ssh\\config` for Windows / `~/.ssh/config` for Linux/MacOS. If you haven't used this file before, then an empty config file will open. You should copy in the following instructions:

```c
Host arena
    HostName <ip-address>
    User root
    IdentityFile <path-to-ssh-key>
    Port <port>
```

With all values filled in.

<br>

</details>

Once you've set up your machine, go to the section "Connect to your instance" below.

#### Connect to your instance

- Make sure your config file is set up correctly (this is the last instruction in each of the dropdowns above for the different possible cloud providers).
- Open the VS Code command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P in Windows, Cmd+Shift+P in Mac), and search for & choose the option "Connect to Host...". The host `arena` should appear as one of the hosts. Choose this option.
- A new VS Code window will open up. If you're asked if you want to install the recommended extensions for Python, click yes. If you're asked to choose an OS (Windows, Mac or Linux), choose Linux.
- Click on the file explorer icon in the top-left, and open the directory `ubuntu` (or whichever directory you want to use as your working directory in this machine). 

And there you go ‚Äî you're all set! 

To check your GPU is working, you can run `nvidia-smi` in the remote machine once you've connected via SSH.
This will print some information about the GPU (the type, the amount of VRAM, etc). Once you've verified this is working, you can start running code on the GPU. The easiest way to do this is just to drag and drop your files into the file explorer window on the left hand side.

### Set up your workspace on your VM

You might already know how to do this, but here are the steps I go through (thanks to Arthur Conmy & David Quarel for most of these!). These steps are similar to those in the "Option 2: VS Code" section, except that it also includes instructions for installing miniconda (since our VM is a fresh Ubuntu install, and it doesn't come with miniconda pre-installed).

- Open the VS Code terminal from your remote machine window (keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl + Backtick` for Windows and Linux, or `Cmd + Backtick` for Mac).
- Copy-paste in the following code (you can click on the top-left icon to copy it):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prevent auto tmux
touch ~/.no_auto_tmux

# Create directory for Miniconda and download the installer
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

# Install Miniconda
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3

# Remove the installer script
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

# Initialize Conda for Bash shell
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash

# Source the bashrc to refresh the environment
source ~/.bashrc

# Create a Conda environment
echo "Creating conda environment"
~/miniconda3/bin/conda create -n arena-env python=3.11 -y

# Add conda activation command to bashrc
echo "conda activate arena-env" >> ~/.bashrc

# Activate the Conda environment
source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate arena-env

# Clone the Git repository
git clone https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0.git

# Install Python packages from requirements file
pip install -r ~/ARENA_3.0/requirements.txt
```

- Go grab a coffee. This can take a while!
- When it's done, you should be able to run the exercises!
    - You'll need to first make sure the interpreter is `arena-env` (open command palette, and type "Python: Select Interpreter", then choose `arena-env`).
    - If you're using a Jupyter Notebook, you can change the kernel by clicking on the `Kernel` tab, then `Change kernel`, then `arena-env`.

See the [prerequisites section](https://arena3-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/[0.0]_Prerequisites) for more advice on using VS Code.


## Structure of the exercise sets

Each set of exercises is designed to take 1 day or more. Each set is structured as follows:

* Reading material (most, but not all exercises will start with reading material)
* Setup (a code block for you to run with all the relevant imports / definitions)
* Exercises

You should read through the reading material as indicated, run the setup code, and then work through the exercises sequentially.

The exercises will typically be split up into subsections (usually between 3 and 6 subsections). For instance, a set of exercises with 3 sections might be indicated with 30%, 20%, 50% on the left-hand contents bar. These are just a rough guide, designed to help you plan your time as you go through the exercises.

There will usually be around 10-20 total exercises per set, spread over the subsections. 

## Structure of individual exercises

Each exercise will come with a description of what you need to do (usually in the form of a function with a docstring which you need to complete), as well as a test function you can run to check your answer. These tests are designed to try and catch most possible ways your function can go wrong, although they won't always be able to capture all possible errors (especially in later chapters). Exercises will also come with estimates for how difficult they are, and how important they are (relative to other exercises in that set). For example, they may look like this:

```c
Difficulty: üî¥üî¥‚ö™‚ö™‚ö™
Importance: üîµüîµüîµ‚ö™‚ö™

You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
```

These are only rough guidelines to help you calibrate yourself as you go through the exercises, and the times will vary depending on your coding speed & level of familiarity with the material. However, if you're spending *much* more than the suggested time on the exercise, then you should consider using the provided solution & moving on to the next exercise. In these cases, do try to read & understand the solution provided, since it's likely to be useful for subsequent exercises.

Exercises will sometimes come with hints, in dropdowns like this one:

<details>
<summary>Click me for a hint!</summary>

Here is the contents of the hint!

Hints should be used liberally. They're designed to help you skip over parts of the exercise which might cause you to be stuck for a long time, so you can focus on the more important parts of the exercise set as a whole.

</details>

You can also use our experimental chatbot assistant to answer questions about the course (navigate to it from the left-hand sidebar). This was inspired by [AlignmentSearch](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bGn9ZjeuJCg7HkKBj/introducing-alignmentsearch-an-ai-alignment-informed), and has similar benefits and drawbacks relative to the alternative of using GPT directly.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback on this course (e.g. bugs, confusing explanations, parts that you feel could be structured better), please let us know in the [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/arena-uk/shared_invite/zt-2noug8mpy-TRYbCnc3pzj7ITNrZIjKww), e.g. the `errata` channel (for mistakes) or `suggestions` channels (for suggestions). We're always looking to improve the course, and we'd really appreciate your input.
"""

# ## Support

# If you ever need help, you can send a message on the ARENA Slack channel `#technical-questions`. You can also reach out to a TA (e.g. Callum) if you'd like a quick videocall to talk through a concept or a problem that you've been having, although there might not always be someone available.

# You can also read the solutions by downloading them from the [GitHub](https://github.com/callummcdougall/arena-v1). However, ***this should be a last resort***. Really try and complete the exercises as a pair before resorting to the solutions. Even if this involves asking a TA for help, this is preferable to reading the solutions. If you do have to read the solutions, then make sure you understand why they work rather than just copying and pasting.

# At the end of each day, it can be beneficial to look at the solutions. However, these don't always represent the optimal way of completing the exercises; they are just how the author chose to solve them. If you think you have a better solution, we'd be really grateful if you could send it in, so that it can be used to improve the set of exercises for future ARENA iterations.
